"Honorable President, I would take your word with great understanding if as President you would say what you say when a lot of Arabs go out every day and night in demonstrations and death cries to Jews and lots of Arabs who live in the country and take advantage of the benefits the state gives and make a living from If you, as President of the State, find it appropriate to condemn all the anti-Israel organizations that live among us and in time of war call our soldiers murderers and criminals but unfortunately did not find it appropriate to do so then forgive me if I am not at all willing to accept from you the statement of racism. So for those you came out to defend are the people that the Israeli police need to investigate and one more thing Mr. President I would start with the outspoken haters of Israel who sit in the Knesset and do not miss any opportunity to slam and spread hatred and abomination towards us Jews.†And another point to think about when the citizens of the country see what is happening in the Knesset and around the country that we hated in every way trying to harm and murder us and the Israeli police do not give an answer even when there are citizens who complain so it is possible and desirable to understand that the people are tired of it !!†So let's not act like the nation that knows and sees exactly who the terrorist is but gives the terrorist what.†And finally, Mr. President, one thing with Israel is alive and well forever",1

"Mr. President, I would like to hear more Jewishness in your messages.†We have forgotten who we are, we have forgotten why we are here.†We forgot why we were deported from here and at the time of the deportation we were promised that we would return.†The president of the Jewish state does not have the privilege of standing in the middle of the sections of society, without siding with the Torah of Israel.†Without the obligation we have as a state to raise with our awareness and identity as Jews !!!†And that out of so much pluralism, progress and crop that has infiltrated our society from destructive self-interested factors we have moved away from our identity.†Even if this specific case was lost, you must understand that your words as president are heard in all sorts of places including other girls who are sadly in this difficult situation.†Right now and you are serving as an encourager for them.†I'm sure this is not what you want.†And not just because of the horrific statistics that predict a life of slavery, humiliation, disgrace and violence.†These are also and mainly because out of ignorance they impose on themselves Crete and so does the dumb mother of this particular girl.†Went and danced on the blood of her daughter and also from ignorance and understanding of the seriousness of this act !!!",1

"Honorable President, since that moment yesterday when I heard about the tragic death of Daniel Tregerman my soul knows no rest.†I also saw your great pain as you comforted his parents.†I just wrote my words to you as a post on the Prime Minister's page.†I asked and thanked in advance if you would discuss my proposal together.†Subconsciously, the name ""Operation Jonathan"" came to my mind at that moment, ""which commemorated the name of my prime minister's brother, a name on which many generations grew up and was educated. I thought that instead of the name"" Eitan Cliff ""(although a name full of meaning but seemed to be automatically removed From some drawer of a government copywriter) it would be appropriate to change the name of the operation to ""Operation Daniel"" (of course with the consent of his parents and family). I am sure that all the people who are hurting like me will unite around the name and thus preserve this sweet, angelic child. Forget who fought and sacrificed their lives for more than 60 other angels, it is also possible that his name and beautiful figure will serve as a guiding light and inspiration for you, our leaders, to do everything, in this historic moment, to reach a comprehensive settlement with the Palestinian people. ""His life in an ugly war of adults, just as right as it is. Thank you very much for listening and good luck in your job.""",0

"Honorable President Mr. Robbie Rivlin.†Mahran Rady, indeed an Israeli citizen, an outstanding athlete and Israel is proud of him.†In the last weeks of the war, many Arab Israeli civilians went out, waved Hamas flags and protested and cursed the IDF soldiers and wished the government heavy losses. Some screamed out of human strife and called for missiles to be sent to the center of the country and IDF for all killed and wounded of our soldiers. In this war, we have repeatedly encountered infidelity of Israeli Arabs to the country in which they live and exist. Most Palestinians do not even call themselves a concept called Palestine. , And all the Arab MKs who declare their hatred of Israel and their identification with the Palestinian people.†When and if the Israeli Arabs prove loyalty to Israel, their country of residence, among other things, tolerance will arise and racism will fade.",1
"The Honorable President Unfortunately, the rabbi of Israel is not yet open to such intermarriage.†Only two or three decades ago, woe to the Ashkenazi who married a Sephardi woman.†Let us not forget the very unfortunate case of a very young 21-year-old girl named Reut, who did not have a supportive family and she married on the eve of a siege in another near the Commissioner's Palace in Jerusalem she had three children and one morning they murdered her and found her with her baby son.†The eldest son was given to a Jewish family and raised as a Jew and the other two children were created with the father and raised as Muslims.†Too bad, hope Morrell's fate is different",1

It seems to me that Moshe Katsav will choose!,1

"Prohibition of marriage with a Gentile is considered the most serious thing, due to the fact that it violates the sanctity of the Israeli nation.†It was considered very serious even before the giving of the Torah, and in this week's parshas we are reading we see how vital it was to fathers and mothers.†This shows that it is at the root of the existence of the Jewish people - the preservation of the continuity of the Israeli nation on the most fundamental biological levels.†Such marriages are considered in principle as a conversion, and in ancient years there would have been seven sitting on whoever would have done so.†This is not to say that there are no charming Gentiles.†There are charming and moral Gentiles, and there are wicked Jews.†But here we are dealing with much deeper planes of life.†Therefore, do not cooperate in any situation and in any way with intermarriage.†http://www.kipa.co.il/ask/show/134617-%D7%90%D7%99%D7%A1%D7%95%D7%A8-%D7%A0%D7%99%D7% A9% D7% 95% D7% 90% D7% 99% D7% 9D-% D7% A2% D7% 9D-% D7% 92% D7% 95% D7% 99",1

Mr. President I am sure you know more than one case of an unfortunate Jewish girl who married an Arab until the wedding was Idalia bought gifts etc. After the wedding the attitude changed and then organizations like Hand to Brothers in complicated operations find the same girls and help them rebuild their lives every now and then They are aware that the emissaries of the husband from whom she fled can reach her and harm her and her family do everything possible to stop the next case before it happens we in a democratic state like her right to marry him so our right to protest and demonstrate against the act she will regret and it will be concluded in a complex operation Another similar organization that wants a Jewish state of Israel and wants the daughters of Israel to marry the people of Israel not to another people unlike the other two religions we do not try to influence people to convert what Christians and Muslims do so we want to maintain the existing Mr. President I very much hope you return from the statement to give your blessing to the wedding,1

"The ""Give a Hand to the Deaf and Handicapped for the Handicapped"" has been active since 1997, dealing with public representation in committees in the Knesset, meetings with MKs and ministers, municipalities and government ministries in order to promote the rights of the deaf and disabled on many issues. In many areas such as: State recognition of the deaf as disabled, access to government buildings, increasing employment of the disabled in the public and private economy, increasing benefits for the disabled and deaf, etc .. And currently, branches have been established throughout the country and abroad, and the association volunteers: professors, lawyers and auditors From its inception until today, all members of the association work voluntarily and all expenses of the association are financed from their own pockets. For this reason, the association decided to work for the receipt of section 46 (approval from the tax authority that allows donors to be taxed). Taxes that it is not possible to receive section 46 as long as there is no minimum income for the association in the amount of NIS 30,000 per year (in money or products). Therefore, as part of our efforts to raise donations, we decided to publicly call for the required amount of money. For more information - 054-4219131.",2

"Honorable President, I am glad that you are the President of the State of Israel, and I wish you the best of blessings and best wishes. Yesterday you raised a status that caused me sorrow and heartache that the President of the Jewish State gives his blessing to the assimilation of a holy daughter of Israel here in the Holy Land.†The honor of our sacred teachings precedes all democracy, because it is the one who has preserved us as the eternal people that sets us apart from all other peoples.†Unfortunately, this is a phenomenon found among our Jewish brethren who tied their lives in the Diaspora.†What will his nephews say in the Diaspora?

"Peace to the Holy People of Israel.†We are going through a difficult period, especially the bereaved families.†It is difficult to say but, thanks to these holy sons, the people were privileged to unite and unite.†God desires our unity and our love for others and mutual guarantee.†It is said that thanks to the righteous women we were redeemed from Egypt and thanks to them will also be redeemed in the coming redemption upon us for good and we will see our heroes back among us alive.†Wonderful mothers and wives, exemplary Jewish families, the sanctification of such a name no doubt made a noise and left a great impression in heaven.†Confidence in the name and acceptance of the terrible and irrevocable decree and the understanding of the plan - this is what drives the ignorant gentile flesh and heart out of his mind.†Such a belief confers many rights on the whole people.†Dear Jews, the time of our redemption is coming.†It's time to act.†We must begin to keep the scripture.†When we keep the scripture God will fight for us.†Anyone who thinks he belongs to a ""Palestinian people"" is of the seed of toil.†It must be killed.†We need a rehabilitation leader and will fight Amalek until his general destruction.†And if we do not have such a leader in this government - it must be replaced.†Stupid and thinking as a sole to define Hamas as the source of the problem and fight against it.†This is a war on windmills.†Hamas is the people and the people is Amalek. Even those who live among us or outside our borders who belong to this people - are of the seed of Amalek.†We have no problem with Arabs, we have a problem with Amalek.†God did not command us to make peace with him but to destroy him.†This is the commandment of the name and anyone who thinks otherwise is wrong and deceives himself.†This people is forced to do good: they could have developed and lived by our side in peace for over 60 years and enjoyed a normal life, full of abundance and all good, but they chose to fight us - just like Amalek.†We call on Stan - a friend and partner for peace Abu Mazen - a seven-faced snake and prostitute who did his doctorate on Holocaust denial.†What is the difference between the Nazis, their name and memory will be erased, and Amalek of the Palestinian people today?†No difference the difference is that today we are, so to speak, stronger than them, but in fact, the opposite is true, they are stronger than us and systematically kill us.†God wants a decisive and wise people.†No king would want his son to act like a rag when he needed to demonstrate authority and determination and leadership.†Similar to a woman what kind of woman would want a husband who acts like a female who cries for her and complains instead of solving problems.†When there is unity and a spirit from the people, everything is blessed, especially in situations that threaten us: Get up and kill him as soon as possible.†May we be blessed that in the head of our country there will be a true leader that our enemies will fear from us even after many years after he joins our ancestors.†So if we want to gain appreciation and respect we have to act accordingly.†The leader will soon be revealed in Gd - our job is to demand it.†We have been redeemed in Nissan and will be redeemed in Nissan.",1
I agree with every word,0
"It seems like it is easy to judge Maccabi Tel Aviv for racism.†But for more years it carries a racist flag, does it pass you by, Mr. President?†Maybe because you are a fan more, so it is easier for you to come to Maccabi with complaints, than to look at what is happening in your stands.",1

He did not say what he really thinks .. I'm sure of that.†And if so then why interfere at all then it's a private event no?†But he chose to continue in Peres' way.†That Jews are murdered then silent and spray-painted graffiti then make a pilgrimage to the village.†It would have been better not to interfere here or here.†He loves the Land of Israel is great but why did we come here?†If this is the result .. that a president encourages assimilation?†!,1
You were elected and became a leftist?†Bibi was right,1

"Honorable President Shalom,, offers you not to take sides and if you decide to express a position it is your duty to condemn both sides,,, violence is celebrated because the Arabs of Israel did not stop rejoicing and rejoicing when our dear soldiers were killed,, our duty to preserve their dignity as their duty to protect us !!!!†I will remind you that Maccabi Haifa played in Austria, they were attacked by anti-Semites, the same Arab player chose to flee and not take sides !!!†From here the rupture started we all realized they are not really part of us and everything is playing !!",1
The right choice for the right man.,0

It was clear to me that we would be elected president!†You're just the one who fits it!†Honorable President-elect: Good luck in everything you do and succeed!,0
"I think people got a little confused here .. with who she chooses to marry is a private matter and maybe I do not agree with it but after all no one would make such a story from the couple if he was not an Arab.†Let's say that if a Jew had married an American Christian they would not have turned the country upside down like this!†Some proportions please as long as she is not your sister or your mother you will take care of your own affairs!†She has been with him for 5 years, converted to Islam for him, this is her choice and her problem !!!!!†Everyone makes their choices we do not have to agree.†And with the honor of speaking out like that against the honor of the President just a shame !!†We have more urgent things to deal with than a girl who fell in love with an Arab.",1
I also think and hope that the next president is Ruby - holding fingers and wishing success,0
"One should simply distinguish between racism and incitement to violence for which there is no place at all, and an act that harms us as a Jewish people, tends to harm the tradition that brought us to be what we are and such an act deserves to be condemned.†Just as every person has the ability to fill swastikas around him, but it is an act that does not conform to morality .. There are acts that are legally permissible but morally have no place, and for that the understandable pain of anyone who rebels against it, only violence and incitement is something unrelated Does not belong at all to the fact that we are Jews.",1
"Ruby Are you ready for your daughter to be your granddaughter? You will marry if an Arab. I believe not then, Your Honor. I do not think you should interfere in this sensitive issue.",1
Good luck to you,0
Just not being Netanyahu's accompanying star was you!†Man of Jerusalem and the Greater Land of Israel !!!,0

You have a special light ... God is with you ..,0
"Our dear President.†Even in office as president, one must have the courage to say what the people think.†To encourage and not to condemn the daughters of Israel, who marry Arab Muslims, is a red line for the Jewish people who have maintained their Judaism for thousands of years.†The phenomenon of Arabs wanting to harm the Jewish people has found a way to humiliate us in an attempt that, unfortunately, sometimes succeeds in misleading Jewish girls.†One should not be ashamed to really say what the left does not like to hear.†I think we should be resolute and say in a wavy bristle that the Jewish people must guard against such phenomena.",1

Mr. Rivlin. Go to work. The city and the country are on fire with a wave of hatred and racism. Your best friends for Meridor and Livni have been silenced. The gravel is spilled and the stench is terrible. Please do something before destruction.,1
The Rivlin loan would have been better for you to shut up.†On this was said a sage for wisdom and silence.†Apparently there was a mistake in electing the president.†This has been proven for several days after you were elected.†But I tell you that many will say that these are nonsense that infuriates and irritates anyone who has a Jewish soul in his nose.†Woe to you and woe to those who hear your foolish words.†Contempt for you You shame the institution of the presidency from now on Know that you do not represent many others and me too.,0

There are organizations that work here, and cast terror and terror beyond condemnation. It is time to act ... to prosecute anyone who threatens, silences, silences ... prosecute Anyone who acts and personally attacks bodies and places just because of their political opinion.†It's probably just a barren appeal that you will not even read ... but it's a desperate call from a citizen, once our threat was external, for the first time I feel threatened by the citizens of my country ...",0

"** Especially for you Honorable President - ** Article: ""What is really the difference between racism and assimilation"" ""? The difference between them is like the difference between heaven and earth. And if I am against the assimilation and interference of the people of Israel, does that mean I am racist and immoral ???? , I have gentile friends and I respect them, and help them, and for full equality between all, and coexistence and everything is good and excellent among us all, so I am very surprised at those wise and prudent people who say if you do not agree that your sister will marry the gentile who fell in love with him then You are a racist, what nonsense and nonsense, there are certain boundaries that I have to keep just like: in school, in the army and at home that I am not allowed to do and even if the world explodes it is against the rules and laws that accepted me into the army or school To do in the same place, what is so hard to understand, a little sad and sad for me all these comparisons, it is just shame and disgrace that we are dealing with this nonsense and vanity, which feeds us, and the people of Israel have to endure it, at a time when lies became truth and truth became lies. Our eyes to it. As it is written in the Psalms: """" They are poor and will not see ears and no†Hear .. """" There is a state of assimilation and mixing and God forbid the disappearance of Israel and there will be no uniqueness of the people of Israel that the same Jewish people represent to the whole world and in fact all Jewish holidays, Sabbaths, Jewish celebrations, all Jewish events and everything will actually be erased, and it must not happen. Not only to the people of Israel but also to the nations of the world, which we as a nation and as a people have given to the whole world the recognition of Gd and that there is a Creator for creation, and all the various customs that accompany it, so it is inconceivable that the source of all this be erased from the map. """" There is a terrible assimilation, so at least in the Holy Land it is our duty to keep and avoid it) because in the end, at the end of the correction of the world as it is written: """" Isaiah) """" that everything depends on Israel and what is happening in the whole world """" (the Zohar), that everything actually happens because of the actions of Israel and therefore our moral and global duty, not only personal to maintain our borders and uniqueness as a people for all humanity to whom we grant it, so it is very important that we marry """" According to the religion of Moses and Israel """" which are the ones who instilled in us and us†Drink the faith in one God, unique and special !!†""",1

That a president in the Land of Israel will give backing to assimilation ... This is itself a very serious rushing disease ... without beautification of the soul ... There is a Torah for the people of Israel before a morbid democracy that blurs the identity of the Jew.,1

For those who say we mixed with the peoples therefore Jews came from everywhere in the world it is a lie !!! and a lie !!! The Jews in the world kept themselves from mixing and lived in the ghettos were educated like you Who said to love and got married to Gentiles what is left of them no one knows ... 3. The great Torah scholars and sages of the generation (not Ben Gurion and Herzl who among the fools used to call them """" sages of the generation """") said that the Holocaust came because there was tremendous assimilation and data of 60 % Or more ... what to do you annoyed Gd ... another little thing ... For someone who thinks that Gd is primitive and does not encourage love he is wrong ... Gd is love in its embodiment once he says to keep mitzvos and people do not keep he can destroy the world in an instant But no ... he loves humanity! Gd foresaw that he was having ""love"" problems with our enemies so he said to expel the peoples who were here 3000 years ago (to†Palestinians) so that we do not encounter them ... why do you think alone they do evil in the eyes of Gd working for other gods ... that their work was probably one of the most stinking for those who have learned and know what it is ... they will miss us and our daughters and sons and Gd does not want the people That he chose him to mingle with other Gentiles ... lacking Jews?†Missing conversions?†No then start working!†Gd commands us to marry whoever does not marry is a transgression we are commanded to love our wives as our body and respect them more than our body unlike Islam ... that a woman is an object that is used and thrown in the trash ...

"Before 16 (I am a veteran in the country) I took paid 4,000 NIS for driving lessons, and did not pass the first test.†I took more lessons for the second test but the money was not enough to take more lessons and then I stopped.†Today exactly the same thing happened to me.†Today the legal situation is even more difficult for people in a difficult financial situation like mine because dependence on an internal test causes all driving instructors to submit the student to an external test based on considerations of financial greed that first of all they try to spend as much money as possible on driving lessons. Still not ready ""that she's an excuse that the law recognizes as legal and that's a problem because it's being abused and spurs driving instructors to be greedy for students' money just like a loophole calling for a thief.†Students 'dependence on teachers' ""considerations"" should be eliminated, and just as it is possible to approach a theoretical test when the student feels he is ready for it, so too in the practical driving test who should choose the timing to approach is the student and not someone who receives money from the student for Additional driving lessons depend on the teacher's ""discretion"" who ""believes"" that the student is not yet ready for the external test.†The negligent law that exists today that hangs the student's timing to take an external test in the driving instructor hurts first and foremost people with very low incomes who can not continue to pay for additional driving lessons and get stuck even without a chance to do a second test, even without a driver's license and stuck with bigger expenses in advance. Driving lessons taken.†I am currently stuck with no money to pay for more driving lessons, but in the coming months my bank account will be paid for the checks I gave to the driving school, and I am well known in the welfare bureau.†Just yesterday I received from my social worker a social report to receive food from an association whose manager replied that only in September would they be tested whether to help me with food once a month.†My monthly income is NIS 3,000, known and recognized by the National Insurance Institute due to functional limitations and despite the limitations I still work hard.†But my only income is as stated NIS 3,000, and from it I have to pay rent, electricity, water, property taxes and expenses and always be preoccupied with surviving when every month there are commitments for current expenses and this driving lessons were such expenses that at the end of the month I will have a hard time continuing to pay.†I would like to offer you to propose an amendment or legislation aimed at making it easier for low-income earners to spend on driving lessons.†My idea is that some of the people who want to enlist in the army (or national service) at a later age (e.g. 30 years old), and in the meantime will be drivers, are those who in the public service will take a driving instructor course and give driving lessons in their national service or service. The military.†People who want to learn to drive and do not have money, will bring a certificate from a social worker on low income and will be able to receive unlimited driving lessons.†For covering the state's expenses in parking vehicles and fuel, it is possible to charge each driving student only 10 NIS per driving lesson.†In such a situation, the state will be able to facilitate people like me, the public will be able to get people to take driving lessons to drive carefully on the road and prevent road accidents, and also will be able to run such a low-income driving lessons service because they will be required to pay a reduced price for driving lessons.†How about formulating this idea into a bill and submitting it to the Knesset?†I would love to receive feedback on my idea and your willingness to promote it into a bill / amendment to the law.†Lena """,2

"Monday - Good Week and Congratulations Elijah the Prophet Remember well in honor of the Prime Minister: If his honor is in the Land of Israel, on earth then the old news is actually: - Arabs kill an Arab and burn him (only an Arab knows where the victim is at 3 in the morning, at the entrance to a mosque , That no Jew will approach there, only an Arab who kills with many stabs and burns the victim so that there will be no evidence), and this is neither the first nor the last time.It is an art that these human animals often use, to accuse Israel of the world, and riot (they also take care not to burn There will be traces ... like the 3 children's vehicle.) And of course the police will not be able to decipher this murder for a long time, if at all, because these human animals will surely interfere with it and hide this shameful murder inside them, with the help of Oslo criminals and the deadly and submissive left. , Be'er Sheva, Netivot, Sderot, Yom Yom, Lila Lila ... - Stone-throwing riots all over the country, including our wounds and much destruction, fires, train stations used by these human animals in Jerusalem, buses and streets and shops ... Your left), narrow to internal insecurity, and from the police, and other Oslo criminals of all kinds: - We will catch the†The murderers 'settlements (it is clear as day that this is Arab work, the main thing is to apologize even before an interrogation ...

The Arabs have trapped you again!†If the cowardly and defeatist Jews admit that they murdered, then we have achieved the goal and we will start rioting !!!†The whole world will see ... - The Likud's proposal for their homes: If there is silence, we will be quiet ... (the deadly and immoral Oslo mentality again).†In other words, the Israeli government is begging for peace, on all fours, after the murder of our children, the shelling of our cities, and the rioting of these human animals every day ... - We will deploy iron domes, also in Modi'in and the central region ... - The slogans of defeat, shame and lethality , The situation needs to be calmed down, it is not wise to attack, it is forbidden to enter Gaza ...) At the height of the immorality and defeatism that the left is not ashamed to display, after thousands of Oslo murderers ... and the people of Israel hear and do not believe.†Crying under a barrage of missiles (which have not yet reached Tel Aviv ... so no problem).†Benjamin, how long is your role and our country despicable ?!†The more you bow down, the more the enemy will riot and kill and shell ... You will start behaving like the Prime Minister of Israel, from the head and not the belly, and you will kill and kill and destroy without mercy and without hesitation any enemy raised against us, in Gaza, inside occupied Israel (Ramallah, Hebron, East Jerusalem ... ) And everywhere!†You said ""Get up early to kill him"" ""! But in practice the Likud their homes do the opposite ... release murderers, again the nasty and immoral Oslo slogans ... and you are paralyzed!
