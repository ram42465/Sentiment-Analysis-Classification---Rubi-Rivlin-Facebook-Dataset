"Enough to get people into the gut and private life. Throughout history, Jews have married their neighbors and survived as Jews. A little tolerance for God's sake. The Jewish people are full but full of assimilation and history proves it. In general, there is a controversy over who we are, we are in general. Even when the Jewish people wandered in the desert for 40 years, non-Jewish nomads who simply immersed themselves in it were added and observed. And in general even King David was a descendant of Shiksa a redhead.",1

"Hello friends. I call on you today to come and take each and every small step, but together we will create a big wave, for you, for us, for the nature of the country and the future of the country in which we live. A step against violence, racism, coercion, chauvinism, well-being and diversion. And especially mainly against the denial of freedom of choice, the denial of personal liberty, the denial of the right to freedom of religion, worship and conscience. Rights enacted at the foundation of the establishment of the state in the Declaration of Independence. And above all these against the denial of the most basic and primary right given to each and every one of us as human beings - the right to love. And want to deny it to us. For those who did not hear and did not know: http://www.globes.co.il/news/article.aspx?did=1000963602 There is an inciting, violent, racist, and illegal organization that came today to destroy and destroy a wedding in Israel, just because in their dark and dark eyes an event It is forbidden to exist and must be destroyed solely because the groom is Muslim and the bride is Jewish. I repeat - solely because the groom is Muslim and the bride is Jewish. This is nothing more than that. A couple, a man and a woman who have fallen in love and want to get married and start a family, while the forces of darkness want power, violence, brutality, racism and dark fanaticism to sword and prevent this event. Only because the groom is Muslim and the bride is Jewish. Think about it for a moment - deprive them of the natural human right given to them to fall in love and start a family. Only because the groom is Muslim and the bride is Jewish. And think about it again for a moment - it sounds bad even from dark and dark days and bars in the boyhood days. And this is here with us, in the State of Israel, in the 21st century. Friends, friends and friends, I am sure that if you have heard and read you are shocked, angry and irritated like me, from this violent phenomenon, and such an event is going to take place tonight and take place among us. It does not matter if you are left or right, religious or secular, urban or rural, we do not want it in a state of freedom like ours, that will try to force on us violently, grossly, predatory and brutally violate our basic freedoms, one of which is the right to love and start a family . I know those who come to the sword are a minority, a handful of instigators, who only make a big noise. But we need today to say enough, enough, to show the voice of the sane majority, not just to be shocked and angry, these to take action. Each and every one of us in a small step and together a big wave. I call on all of us to come and demonstrate today against the forces of darkness that will try to destroy the marriage against, coercion and racism. This is to show that in our country, where we work, where we laugh, where we bring our child, where we pay taxes, where we serve in the army, who fight for it and even die, where we dream our dreams, where we plan our future - freedom and suffrage , The right to choose and love and start a family is ours. We will gather quietly near the event that will take place today - at 19:30 in the Red Sun Hall, 1 Altalena Street, Rishon Lezion. To strengthen and demonstrate against. Thank you for distributing this post and reading it to all your friends and sharing as much as possible.",1

"Someone commented to me Natalie are private individuals getting married what .... and I could not see the sequel. In any case, they are not private individuals who marry in principle. His father said explicitly, and on his own initiative, that he was a ""Palestinian"" and if they were freedom and liberal advocates like Moran supporters on our side they would not force her to convert to Islam. Go to them. Within a week she was a mother slave. This is one of the new levels, and the easiest in the situation of today's girls, to slowly disintegrate Judaism, to crumble it. That's what kept us in the Diaspora for 2000 years. But she will privately do what she wants, for me even when she starts getting beaten. ""And come and cry not to help her. I did not intervene, I did not share fan parties and I did not go to the demonstration, for me the struggle is the good education I received that also went to my brothers who go to my nephews and I will pass on to my children.

Shame on you for contradicting your values. You yourself say that contacts for the age of 18 and above everyone decides for himself and if so he decided to marry an Arab nothing happened. Even a Jewish couple who marries and does not get along are divorcing each other to all those who say tomorrow she will come back beaten and divorced. I want to tell you that the percentage of divorced Jews is among the Jews. Let them start their way and wish them good luck.,1
"A democratic state also needs red lines as to what is allowed and what is forbidden. A country with a Jewish flag and a Jewish pardon should not allow this type of marriage, anyone who wants such a marriage to marry and live abroad, food for thought their children were Muslims or Jews",1

The rabbi will help you and make you a soldier for our country. You deserve the most deserving of them all.,0

"Ruby, see you're a humble person. Even your inbox proves it.",0
Rivlin will start being a Jew and not support me an assimilator who became a Muslim and married Muhammad Basha as the president of the Jewish state who expresses support for this assimilated daughter who married an Arab Muhammad whose children will grow up as Muslims and at age 7 start throwing stones at their Jewish grandparents.,1
"Yes, we'll see him talking if his daughter marries a Muslim ..... come on without beautifying this whole case crossed proportions because it's posted but there are the assimilated girls assimilating and let's admit none of us would want this for his children as they would not want their children We will marry Jews",1

Honorable President could the couple marry more modestly no one would feel I am in favor of freedom of expression and coexistence I just want Jewish rehabilitation and marry some Arab and then we will see the real face of the sector. The two were sentenced to death,1
"This is what these serious people had to say about Islam. Whereas you, a Jew who was privileged to see the huge gap between Judaism and Islam, as the advantage of light from darkness, support your statement in the Judaism of a Jew and her assimilation with a foreigner. As a descendant of the Rivlin family and a son of the Jewish people, are you not ashamed to read what you wrote ?? Could you be willing to support the terrible assimilation that consumed parts of our people and led to a spiritual annihilation that also led to a physical annihilation just to please the eyes of many who were alienated from Judaism !? Reuben (Ruby) Rivlin, do not shame yourself and your family and do not forget that Gd brought you to this position so that you can act for His name and the honor of His people.",1
A true righteous and honest man and a humble and honest man of clusters remains only to wish good luck and that you will win because you deserve to be elected you with the beautiful and pure Israel.,0

"Honorable President, I would take your word with great understanding if as President you would say what you say when a lot of Arabs go out every day and night in demonstrations and death cries to Jews and lots of Arabs who live in the country and take advantage of the benefits the state gives and make a living from If you, as President of the State, find it appropriate to condemn all the anti-Israel organizations that live among us and in time of war call our soldiers murderers and criminals but unfortunately did not find it appropriate to do so then forgive me if I am not at all willing to accept from you the statement of racism. So for those you came out to defend are the people that the Israeli police need to investigate and one more thing Mr. President I would start with the outspoken haters of Israel who sit in the Knesset and do not miss any opportunity to slam and spread hatred and abomination towards us Jews. And another point to think about when the citizens of the country see what is happening in the Knesset and around the country that we hated in every way trying to harm and murder us and the Israeli police do not give an answer even when there are citizens who complain so it is possible and desirable to understand that the people are tired of it !! So let's not act like the nation that knows and sees exactly who the terrorist is but gives the terrorist what. And finally, Mr. President, one thing with Israel is alive and well forever",1
"Shabbat Shalom and Blessed is the Honorable President, Blessed be God who hears good news about the abductees Amen",0
"Mr. President, I would like to hear more Jewishness in your messages. We have forgotten who we are, we have forgotten why we are here. We forgot why we were deported from here and at the time of the deportation we were promised that we would return. The president of the Jewish state does not have the privilege of standing in the middle of the sections of society, without siding with the Torah of Israel. Without the obligation we have as a state to raise with our awareness and identity as Jews !!! And that out of so much pluralism, progress and crop that has infiltrated our society from destructive self-interested factors we have moved away from our identity. Even if this specific case was lost, you must understand that your words as president are heard in all sorts of places including other girls who are sadly in this difficult situation. Right now and you are serving as an encourager for them. I'm sure this is not what you want. And not just because of the horrific statistics that predict a life of slavery, humiliation, disgrace and violence. These are also and mainly because out of ignorance they impose on themselves Crete and so does the dumb mother of this particular girl. Went and danced on the blood of her daughter and also from ignorance and understanding of the seriousness of this act !!!",1
"There are things honorary president. ""That silence is good for them"" will stop trying to get prettier",1

I want to congratulate the new president. And wish longevity and health to the outgoing president and thanks to a huge leader who has contributed greatly to the State of Israel.,0
Rivlin you are disappointing,1
"Congratulations on your post and the non-obvious reference, Mr. President, to this issue. I am glad that you have set yourself the goal of focusing on the issue of the rifts in Israeli society, the racism and violence that threaten to destroy every good part of the State of Israel. Thank you !",0

What a sweet success Robbie Rivlin I have no doubt he will be a successful president,0
"I was very happy that the exercise Bibi tried to do yesterday was not successful. We have not seen such two-facedness in a long time. He has no shame. I wish Bibi up to 120 years, provided he sleeps overnight with Sarah. There is no heavier punishment than this.",0
"I would like to wish you personally success in all your work and in the race for the presidency.

"Do not be disappointed, they are building on you!",0
Continue to support assimilation ... maybe some Jew will fall in love with a family member of a terrorist or the terrorist himself or a Jew will fall in love with a terrorist Arab and their love will lead to unity and coexistence. Tragerman was killed by our Arab enemies under the auspices of the Ishmael government that Gd would pay them badly for the relief you give the Arabs and for the 100% restraint you show toward them. May his memory be blessed and rest in heaven alongside the righteous of Israel.,1
Successfully !!!,0
You forgot to mention the honor of the president - but not in our school. The State of Israel must not give in to assimilation. And certainly not to encourage. Perhaps this time silence was preferable on the part of His Excellency.,1
Blessed is the president who transmits positive energies everywhere,0

"Clean hands and a good heart, straighten the power of a dear example and the symbol of the name will protect you and your family",0
"Honorable President, since that moment yesterday when I heard about the tragic death of Daniel Tregerman my soul knows no rest. I also saw your great pain as you comforted his parents. I just wrote my words to you as a post on the Prime Minister's page. I asked and thanked in advance if you would discuss my proposal together. Subconsciously, the name ""Operation Jonathan"" came to my mind at that moment, ""which commemorated the name of my prime minister's brother, a name on which many generations grew up and was educated. I thought that instead of the name"" Eitan Cliff ""(although a name full of meaning but seemed to be automatically removed From some drawer of a government copywriter) it would be appropriate to change the name of the operation to ""Operation Daniel"" (of course with the consent of his parents and family). I am sure that all the people who are hurting like me will unite around the name and thus preserve this sweet, angelic child. Forget who fought and sacrificed their lives for more than 60 other angels, it is also possible that his name and beautiful figure will serve as a guiding light and inspiration for you, our leaders, to do everything, in this historic moment, to reach a comprehensive settlement with the Palestinian people. ""His life in an ugly war of adults, just as right as it is. Thank you very much for listening and good luck in your job.""",0
"Well done, President Rivlin. You start with the right leg. Not to the violence on the football fields and on the other fields. Violence breeds violence both inside and outside. If you carry this flag there is a chance that change will come. After all, it all starts from above. And you are the most up. With all due respect . good week . Naomi Alon",0

How much hypocrisy can there be here! Where are the condemnations of the Israeli Arabs that the state is burning for us. Every time a fuse is burned for them? It was . And it will continue to be!,1

Love you good luck,0
Align Ruby Force. The people of Israel deserve a president like you.,0
There is no one like Rivlin like you !!,0
Isn't it strange to you that at his extreme age he remembers a venture that has existed for over 20 years?,1
Wait .. if we were assimilated as early as 2000 years ago when the Romans exiled our parts ... would not that have prevented all this rush?,1
so sad,0
What a pity what an amazing kid,0
Good luck to you our tenth president ????,0
Martin Rivlin King,0
"How can the President of the State of Israel open his mouth in favor of such trouble ?! Did you see the father's video? Do you know what it is for him? It's worse than sitting seven, knowing that your daughter is alive and living in an Arab neighborhood / village and a Muslim maid I would rip a shirt off. I believe you know what the girls who converted to Islam and chose this way go through on the other side, most of them eventually return to the real house. You know in yourself that this is a shocking thing and you speak like a beautiful soul because you ""president"" want to please everyone but that is a lie !!! Shame you are encouraging it. When it comes to the gate of this narrow house you will understand Morel's father. Next time you will really write down what you think and not write down anything to come out beautiful! Be as real as a prize.",1

"Do well if you calm down and do not preach to Israelis what to say. Enough that your prime minister neutered us physically, do you want to neuter us in another way? If you start persecuting Jews with the attorney general you will end up like Peres.",1
"do not like ! One can not react, one can object, one can and should oppose violence, but congratulate? You were wrong Mr. President in this writing and I was wrong in my appreciation of you. For thousands of years, Jews have been fighting against assimilation, especially in these days in the Diaspora. In your writing you have torn a large part of the people from their support of you. I currently have no president!",1
On this it is said the honorable President handsome demands even more handsome sustains,2
This was supposed to be normal and routinely became a dream of many in Israeli society,1

wonderful ....,0
All the ponytail,0
We were lucky to have such a president,0
Very exciting love you and together forever ?????,0
Oh how heartbreaking!,0
Robbie Rivlin You have changed and not for the better. It looks like your child will come and say Dad I'm marrying Goya what so you would say. So do not be beautiful. You were disappointed in your last statement. And it's not just me talking about you everywhere. And on the subject of the mixed wedding,1
May their memory be blessed with the people of Israel and live for generations to come,0
"""An integral part of the Israeli experience"" ?! What is the ""Israeli experience""? Something like a ""shopping experience"" or a ""service experience""? Are you the president of a country or a supermarket? Please tell me you meant ""being"" and your assistants did not accidentally recognize the auto-correction.",1
"Interesting that suddenly people who go out against confusion are in your eyes inciting people! Is the president in favor of assimilation and even encourages it? According to you, it probably is, and it's very, very sad",1
A completely false message !!!,1

"The symbolic act is very beautiful, Your Honor, in the population it seems to me that above a certain age, organs are no longer harvested.",0
You're just a racist pushing your stinking ass everywhere. Go and look for the origin of your ancestors from a thousand years ago and you will discover that all the Eastern communities are Arabs who converted to Judaism a thousand years ago and annexed to the people of Israel.,1
"Rivlin with Israel is ashamed of you, not forgotten or forgiven",1
"There are no words to describe the joy! As a Jerusalemite, as a Likud member and as a young man in this country, I am proud of you, dear Ruby, and I am proud that from now on the title of President of the State of Israel will be added to your name. Long live the President of the State of Israel!",0
And now you will be free to deal with corruption,0
Amen ! What a lovely kid! The debt is torn! Why did he not keep it?,0
Honorable President (soon) and what will we do? Will we continue to hold the terrorists on five-star terms? Will we release them lest maybe just hear someone agree to talk to us? On the blood of these children you will swear that you will never give a hand to the pardon and release of terrorists.,1
"Heartfelt congratulations, who love you Tzipi and Yossi",0
"Honorable President Dear and beloved man who will smile successfully all your life. Even these days we will know how to maintain high morale and joy of life. The people of Israel live and exist forever, loved and appreciated",0
Honorable President Robbie Rivlin as a former Likudnik and as a religious person it is hard for me to hear from you giving legitimacy to such a thing it must not happen because it is their power over us they humiliate them because they are Jewish and turn them into slaves and beat them mercilessly no and no,1
Good luck Shabbat Shalom,0
"President of a talkbackist - as we said when he was elected: ""evil in the minority"" """"",1

"The man wishes all Israeli students a pleasant freedom, what are you pushing your nonsense here ?? You will find the right place to respond!",0
"Reuven Rubi Rivlin --= We finally have a president with a good heart and sensitivity to others. Well done, Mr. President. I longed for her to win the presidential nomination and not disappoint my hopes.",0

We understand that you are the left-wing president already .....,1
The people of Israel guarantee each other like the crew of a ship that can not be one will make a hole in his room in the ship and say it's my room it's not your business when he sinks the whole ship with him with Israel it is one body of God one and only,1
You are the president of the Jewish state! Pacquiao,1
There's nothing like Rivlin loving you,0
"Good luck on the new presidential path in the hope, once again, to be attentive to each and every one of the citizens of Israel ...",0
"Indeed, he deserves a pardon from the president, even though he was convicted of the crime, the conviction and all that it entails is a sufficient punishment for a person in his status and illness.",1
President Robbie Rivlin is proud of you !!!! Too bad harsh reactions and profanity are directed at you. You are a role model for the State of Israel. Who will give and multiply people like you !!!!!,0

A holiday from the Rivlin family,0
"Sorry but you guys make me laugh terribly. Take a walk on every street in every Jewish city in Israel and watch passers-by. You can identify ""Russians"", ""Moroccans"", ""Yemenis"", ""Anglo-Saxons"", etc., etc. - all Jews. How did it happen exactly that the people of Israel in exile became similar to all these peoples if there were none ""It's not His Excellency the President who is painted here and not this wedding is the disease that endangers our society from within. Shabbat Shalom to all human dignitaries.""",0
Thank you to the Honorable President for his present words.,0

How sad ... little angel. My heart goes out to the family,0
Not welcoming. Assimilation exterminated 6 million Jews.,1
"MK Reuven Rivlin. I was very much in favor of Dalia Dorner and Professor Shechtman, until I saw the testimony of Ilan Gilon. You see, I vote for Meretz and I will remain so, and your political vision is as far east as west. But as they say, tell me who your honesty advocates are, and I'll tell you who you are. So good luck in the presidential race. A little less successful in realizing your political-economic vision :-)",0
"There is nothing more suitable than you, your opponents also agree! Good thing their eyes were opened one hour earlier!",0
"Too bad you were in Beit Shemesh and only came to a certain population, you forgot about us",1

Write for the benefit of the Jewish people for that you are there if you did not understand !!!,1
I really appreciate you,0
"Honorable President, I address you with a painful voice and tears in the eyes of such a little angel. Why should there be a sacrifice like thousands of other victims of his age on the other side ... It hurts us all and I wish we could stop it and strive for this terrorism to stop ... And there will be no more ...",0
"Keep dreaming, as time goes on the Arabs just hate us more and we continue to give them a stage and rights until one day they make a move on us. Not to mention what is going on in Europe and the rest of the world in terms of Islam. Do you also want to give them what we have left? You probably learned that in order to get on stage in this country you have to turn left at an intersection.",1
the heart is Broken,0
Sderot points to Ruby Ravlin.,0
"Honorable President, do not believe them even forty years in the grave",0

Very nice Honorable President congratulations to you !!!!,0
"Ruby after being elected cut 80% of the President's budget. And passed it on to Holocaust survivors and the weak from your people Israel. This is how a president who is sensitive to public sentiment is measured. Show a personal example. After all, you are now a No. 1 citizen. And you have something to live on",0
Dear Ruby - we all hope you - the most suitable - will be our next president.,0
Why not arrest their parents until our sons are released,1
And why does the President of Israel welcome the prohibition of the Torah of Moses ??,1

"Straighten up, Mr. President <3",0
It is good that the President of Israel has finally remembered the Arab population living in this country. Hope this is a good start! On that occasion my condolences to the Krakara family on the tragic tragedy and death of their son Muhammad.,0
Good luck Mr. Rivlin what a pride we have a president like you,0
Ruby Soul is the time to act for the conference if their mother with all her might does not release prisoners to blow up atonement to the end I am willing to endure Katyushas for the scoundrels will pay,1
"Eric, my father, Rinat and Maria - who wants to be like you. Be ashamed of the words you type. Sub-level of expression. If you are part of the Jewish people, who wants to be a part of it. Disgusting as you are.",1
A pleasure that Ruby is the president. Rejoices from it every time again! ** Not cynically **,0
"Their right of course to do what's in their head, but I would not wish them good luck as if it were a routine wedding event. After all, we are also supposed to be against the assimilation of our people, right?",1
"What is all the fuss about, friends? You can tell her your words in a short time at a battered women's home near your home, or at most we'll find her slaughtered in some urban landfill, Big Deal",1
"Ruby, you do not need the people, it is your hope that you will be the President of the State of Israel who will make a positive change, balance the weak and the strong, let the elderly and Holocaust survivors live with dignity, finally make a revolution in Social Security and raise benefits for all eligible people. Success in the new position",0
It is gratifying to hear that one of the most influential people in the country expresses his opinion on the subject and even more gratifying when it is the President,0
What a cute grandson. And to you the President of the State Good luck.,0

"I was happy when you were elected but right now you are ashamed of your role. The State of Israel belongs only to Jews, we are indeed a democratic state but to support the marriage of this mixture is already a shame !!!! Believe me if this was your relative you would not wish for what you wished",1
"With all due respect to you, and there. This time I do not agree with you. And the fact that Jabotinsky wrote something does not mean that it is a Torah for Moses from Sinai. So what . I also wrote a lot of things. A Jewish state is first and foremost a Jewish one. And as a minister, I would be careful not to make such a thing legitimate. With all that I think they have a free choice. There are still things that the Arabs guarantee to each other, and the Arabs think it is right to intervene and save. It is no different from suicide. If someone commits suicide, it is imperative to intervene. Sometimes it's the same thing.",1

You deserve respect for Israel,0
Only salvation will help you will repent properly so will help! Dear parents you will pray for salvation only he will bring back your child and souls first,0
"How does the president-elect of the Jewish state indirectly support assimilation? A real shame. The dignity of the working souls is no more important than the criminal act of assimilation, if there is even indirect support from the president it is extremely serious and degrades the institution of the presidency of the Jewish people.",1
Just do not break your leg like Bibi Netanyahu lol,1
"On this occasion I congratulate you Robbie on my behalf and on my last name for being elected President of the State. Believes that we will soon discover your sensitivity to your people, the love of man and the look at eye level. The blessing is also directed to comfort, helped against in the full sense of the word. Mina Shenhar remembers the grace of the days in the rest of Jerusalem",0
Succeed !,0
Good luck sir,0
You Zero !!!,1
Rivlin's father desperately wanted his son to be president but if he were alive today he would regret and be ashamed ... Rivlin will let you know that your daughter and yesterday's daughter who celebrated with the Arab are the same daughters of a righteous Jewish world creator who were lost ... and yet it does not justify agreeing with her and wishing Why congratulations ..,1
"And Your Honor, you do not have to comment on everything. You would do well to fill your mouth with water on this issue. It has already been said, ""Sage to wisdom is silent."" ""Sometimes we need to know when to be silent. Well, maybe we are looking for wisdom where it is not?""",1
May the memory of the little angel be blessed and his soul bundled in the bundle of life participating in the deep sorrow of the family very sad sad,0
"Robin Rivlin left and B'Tselem asked you to incite against the people of Israel against the soldiers, so it is not incitement and that Jews are revolting about assimilation, so it is incitement",1

And I still did not mention the disconnection that will be caused to her from the family ... I am not in favor of violence or demonstrations but it is unfortunate and painful ...

"Mr. President, I understand that it is more convenient for you to express an opinion that will win sympathy and I understand that it is more convenient for you to be perceived as enlightened, liberal and progressive. But by supporting assimilation, whether directly or indirectly, you are giving up a Jew among your people. You are the president of the Jewish state !! You can not give up Jews from your people like that and give them the blessing of the way to convert to Islam and live their lives as Muslims. Unfortunately, this is a backward phenomenon that even more backward people in our nation support - assimilation. So once she was your own, now she's a Muslim against you. Do not you care? The main thing is that we become enlightened and advanced. Sometimes I ask myself if I live in the Jewish state or in some stupid version of a European state.",1

"The Arabs who are an integral part of the Israeli experience. You live in a movie, and you do not seem to differ in your views from your predecessors. ""Are you not ashamed? And that Jews are condemned? After all, Rabek Every day you see left-wing people in the Knesset who love terrorists who have at least a few stains and a criminal past. What about all the terrorist attacks that Hamas is doing? Why don't you react to that?"" What is this beautification?

All leftists will go to live in Gaza with the martyrs and missile launchers. What about intermarriage the death of a lovely boy who did no harm to anyone and certainly did not hide behind him a missile launcher.,1
That you continue like this all your life warms the heart,0
It's just a shame the calls to Rady .. and the players are disappointing .. I would expect them to be the first not only to condemn but to act against the phenomenon and first and foremost to give Rady the captain's armband in the upcoming game and get off the field with the first curse directed against him..Maccabi Ta is not Betar A place for racism,0

Good evening guns Mr. President Only now have the factory signed existed for many years.,0
"Robbie (Honorable President is not a title that suits you better) say the end of an act in thought first and a reservation for wisdom and silence. It would be better if you sat quietly and did not take a stand and encourage assimilation. You lost many, many percent of the shares you had with the residents of the country. I am no longer interested in hearing what your semen speaks and what your hands write. Hello hello and do not come to me in a dream (even Shabbat Shalom does not deserve you.",1

"Honorable President Mr. Robbie Rivlin. Mahran Rady, indeed an Israeli citizen, an outstanding athlete and Israel is proud of him. In the last weeks of the war, many Arab Israeli civilians went out, waved Hamas flags and protested and cursed the IDF soldiers and wished the government heavy losses. Some screamed out of human strife and called for missiles to be sent to the center of the country and IDF for all killed and wounded of our soldiers. In this war, we have repeatedly encountered infidelity of Israeli Arabs to the country in which they live and exist. Most Palestinians do not even call themselves a concept called Palestine. , And all the Arab MKs who declare their hatred of Israel and their identification with the Palestinian people. When and if the Israeli Arabs prove loyalty to Israel, their country of residence, among other things, tolerance will arise and racism will fade.",1
"The Honorable President Unfortunately, the rabbi of Israel is not yet open to such intermarriage. Only two or three decades ago, woe to the Ashkenazi who married a Sephardi woman. Let us not forget the very unfortunate case of a very young 21-year-old girl named Reut, who did not have a supportive family and she married on the eve of a siege in another near the Commissioner's Palace in Jerusalem she had three children and one morning they murdered her and found her with her baby son. The eldest son was given to a Jewish family and raised as a Jew and the other two children were created with the father and raised as Muslims. Too bad, hope Morrell's fate is different",1
Good luck to you,0

"Honorable President! Personally I believe that both spouses make a serious mistake, I have no doubt about their love, but it hides from them the harsh reality of life. I was happy to read your response calling for a boundary between the racist incitement prevalent in our places in these difficult days and the privacy of the married couple.",1

"Mr. President, I sympathize with the tendency against intermarriage !!!! But I, along with you, identify like you with human dignity and the freedom of his privacy to decide how his life will be conducted on the family plane. In doing so, I, as a Jew and an Israeli, find it appropriate to condemn those who in their opinion have acquired the right to enter the veins of the other and try to determine for them how their private lives will be conducted. With the help of the name, the extremists (members of all religions !!) will be removed from our lives.",0
You are a wonderful man with a loving and loving heart of gold. To succeed in your path you are most deserving. Health and rest from all the people of Israel and your family.,0
Happy holiday ! This is my girl my love.,0

The right man! Wonderful ! Successfully !!,0
"On a private level - this is the most legitimate and no one is allowed to intervene and tell Mann Dahua who to fall in love with. At the national level, this is a disaster. Their right to protest the wrongful phenomenon of assimilation among the Jewish people. It is interesting that it is precisely the ""enlightened liberals"" of the left who often shout for the end of democracy and the closing of mouths are those who want to prevent right-wing conservatives from protesting and demonstrating, how unsurprising. If democracy, then please to the end: the blade is also allowed to demonstrate and this is an irrelevant argument whether it is a public or private matter, it is desirable that this voice of protest should also be heard. Personally, I have a hard time congratulating the couple on congratulations. Equally difficult to do the opposite. Sit down and do not, better.",1
It seems to me that Moshe Katsav will choose!,1
Thanks,0
"Heartbroken, sad no words, may his memory be blessed!",0
The intended demonstration (in the hope that it will not take place) is worse than any assimilation - is to turn the Jewish masses into human beings,0

What can I tell you? This is their completely private matter.,0
"You are a mass disappointment with Israel. You were pinned on hopes that after the annihilated Peres who ""prays"" in the Vatican, a proud Jewish president came and here is your reaction to the abusive intermarriage.

What fun! Right-wing President Salt of the Earth! Congratulations to all of us on the election of Robbie Rivlin as President! Yes !!! I hope that the fact that Ruby holds liberal positions will not tarnish the policy of the current government and certainly not the next government which will be more right-wing and more national. More secure.,0
I choose Rivlin even though it bothers me that Lieberman said he did not support the denial of Azmi Bishara's immunity.,0
"Honorable President, With all due respect to freedom and democracy, why should we encourage the conversion of Israeli girls? Freedom and democracy is certainly not what Islam symbolizes. Is there freedom of expression here? Not when she was forced to convert to Islam. In the name of freedom and democracy one must explain more what Islam means. Are all our senses dark and unable to distinguish between light and darkness?",1
"Prohibition of marriage with a Gentile is considered the most serious thing, due to the fact that it violates the sanctity of the Israeli nation. It was considered very serious even before the giving of the Torah, and in this week's parshas we are reading we see how vital it was to fathers and mothers. This shows that it is at the root of the existence of the Jewish people - the preservation of the continuity of the Israeli nation on the most fundamental biological levels. Such marriages are considered in principle as a conversion, and in ancient years there would have been seven sitting on whoever would have done so. This is not to say that there are no charming Gentiles. There are charming and moral Gentiles, and there are wicked Jews. But here we are dealing with much deeper planes of life. Therefore, do not cooperate in any situation and in any way with intermarriage. http://www.kipa.co.il/ask/show/134617-%D7%90%D7%99%D7%A1%D7%95%D7%A8-%D7%A0%D7%99%D7% A9% D7% 95% D7% 90% D7% 99% D7% 9D-% D7% A2% D7% 9D-% D7% 92% D7% 95% D7% 99",1

"Monday - Peace and blessings, as Minister Danon has already said, Russian President Putin would rescue the abducted children and wipe out some terrorist villages ... and the IDF is afraid to enter the mosques to search underground or in the muezzin towers !!! - Prime Minister's response: I will make sure the prisoners The terrorists will not watch the World Cup in football ... - Lieberman's response (failure boss Aharonovich, Minister of Internal Security): ""You should not stand with a stopwatch"" ""... - and our prime minister bows to Abu Mazen (who laughs at us every day and speaks the opposite way in the media) Every day on the phone, to our shame and contempt for us and our Prime Minister !!! And the people of Israel weep, and suffer and do not believe what they hear! And tell stories to crying mothers ... are these the leaders we pay them?!? If the son of Lieberman or Bibi were abducted, they would also spit in the face of the people of Israel ??? !!! And our excellent and poor soldiers should bow down and not look inside the mosques underground, and be a tool of the Likud their homes that has become a bowing left and their defeat !!! Well, the defeat of the Likud in their homes only crushes a party that the majority of the sobering people of Israel regrets choosing! And there is no doubt that the Likud will pay their homes dearly for failure after failure ... Needed: A leader for the people of Israel who knows how to speak the language of the Middle East to our enemies (full control ...). """,1

The hallucinatory response. Ask each Arab if he is part of the Israeli experience and we will see what the answers are. I also condemn such readings,1
"Not that I supported the appointment ... indeed, Peres' shoes are huge! , But a beautiful political answer and an amazing Swiss. Anyway ... you should marry whoever comes to her! She wants them to come back after the wedding and beat her later ... please. What do you care at all ?? This is her life .... and yet, since the culture of humiliation is already the majority in the country, and since there are not many differences between this culture and the culture of the Arabs (nevertheless, sociology says that the inferior culture will never be more common) ... this match should not bother anyone, And vice versa. So just because he's an Arab does it bother you all of a sudden ??? And Betar fans do not make you write such posts ?? food for thought ...",1
What you include us with the Arabs only team already you are beautifying who at all wants to save them,1
Disappointed with you dear Ruby. Sometimes silence is better than speech.,1

What a beauty all the fascist monkeys are jumping in front of a mirror.,0
"It is not for the ultra-Orthodox and the women of Israel who see fit to walk around like prostitutes in malls, but when it comes to coexistence, they become numerous. A phrase like: ""A Jew belongs to a Jew and there are red lines"" ""Iran, it's not here! We are a modern country for the peace of the world. Even if I think the issue is controversial why should I go like a bored victim to demonstrate in front of a ballroom?""",1

Since when has Rivlin been a co-worker? I am a dreamer ?,1
"Regardless of what is happening around the act, it is inhumane, and the leaders of the Arab sector 48 have no right to over-exploit Israeli democracy just for the sake of unnecessary statements. Ultimately the murders, and the price tag acts, and the shootings on both sides are temporary that the enemies of peace are trying to make it permanent. It is enough for violence, yes for hope, peace and humanity.",0

Sorry Mr. President but you are talking nonsense do you want the religious leaders of the murderers and kidnappers to pray ??? They preach to their people that a great mitzvah is to murder the finest children of the Creator of the world so what is this nonsense ??? There is one solution and it eliminates talk. You will start destroying and as many Muslims as possible soon the whole world will cry that he did not destroy the snakes = Muslims while they are small !!!! There is one prayer and that is that the Creator of the world will destroy all the sons of the slave Hagar and Ishmael will wipe out their name forever Amen and Amen !!!!!!,2

"It is a pity that they do not really look at the nature of the problem and it is a pity that our leaders wherever they are are always busy showing how seemingly enlightened we are. This is not racism. There are a lot of problems here in this matter. If children are born to her on the one hand according to Islam, they will be considered Muslims according to which they follow the father's religion, while according to Judaism who follow the mother, they will be considered Jews. Where is the matter of holidays, traditions, etc.? Where is the matter that the children will reach 120 where they will have to be buried, is it in a Muslim or Jewish cemetery? I want to see that there are such Arabs who were willing for their daughter to marry a Jew and if there is a drop in the ocean, they will be able to murder her for the honor of the family, and there have never been cases. Not to mention that from the experience of girls who went with minorities only shit came out of this story, starting with the humiliating blows from the family members. A lot of girls got into relationships with members of minorities who did not know in the first place that they were members of minorities or seduced girls from difficult families day in and day out with money. I do not think this is a good start to a relationship.",1

I am convinced that it is enough to take advantage of a tragedy that has hit us all, to allow them to expand within Israel. The man paid the debt owed for an act he did and enough. Therefore, I have a request for the President of the State of Israel, Reuven Rivlin: - The Honorable President, it is time to pardon Yigal Amir, a time to forgive a terrible offense committed by a fatal mistake. We need a time when we will discover true humane wisdom and compassion. This is a person who acted maliciously. The man was an IDF officer, he was a loyal citizen of the state. An offense he committed - while worried about the future of a state. Not while hating a person. He paid a heavy price for an offense he committed. He paid 20 years. Some people take advantage of every circumstance to abuse a Jew. He asks that we no longer be dragged after extremist people who act for political and malicious reasons; it is simply enough to continue the torture of a pointless person. He will be great, wise and compassionate. He asks President Reuven Rivlin to pardon Yigal Amir.",1

Mr. President I am sure you know more than one case of an unfortunate Jewish girl who married an Arab until the wedding was Idalia bought gifts etc. After the wedding the attitude changed and then organizations like Hand to Brothers in complicated operations find the same girls and help them rebuild their lives every now and then They are aware that the emissaries of the husband from whom she fled can reach her and harm her and her family do everything possible to stop the next case before it happens we in a democratic state like her right to marry him so our right to protest and demonstrate against the act she will regret and it will be concluded in a complex operation Another similar organization that wants a Jewish state of Israel and wants the daughters of Israel to marry the people of Israel not to another people unlike the other two religions we do not try to influence people to convert what Christians and Muslims do so we want to maintain the existing Mr. President I very much hope you return from the statement to give your blessing to the wedding,1

"Holocaust in Israel 2014 Most cases of taking children away from their parents were wrong and stemmed from the power of the relief criminals with an opaque and hard heart and too light a pressure on the trigger if only to show that they are God's deputies more than greed. The enormous damage caused to the children who were evicted from their homes and also to the parents cannot be repaired and healed. Remedies criminals should stand trial and receive an actual prison sentence. Only then will you seriously consider giving parents repeated opportunities to prove their parenting ability. Removing a child from his home and removing him from his family is justified only in cases of severe violence (not a flick or pinch that I do not agree with but this is not called severe violence) which endanger their lives and this is not the case in most cases. A poor home is not necessarily a dysfunctional home and poor parents are not without parental ability !!! The Ministry of Welfare should be abolished and its budgets allocated directly to low-income families. All boarding schools, contact centers and the foster care mechanism must be dismantled and closed immediately !! Relief officials act according to the teachings of Gardner who is likened to Hitler of the 21st century and after his crucifixion in the American media, committed suicide like Hitler. For the massive intervention of all to abolish the criminal powers of the relief and welfare workers immediately !!!!!!!!!!!!!!",0

Today the limit in the Ministry of Health is 96 shekels but not written for all the material and the funds and hospitals each interpret it differently and the amounts are accumulated to thousands of shekels!

"The ""Give a Hand to the Deaf and Handicapped for the Handicapped"" has been active since 1997, dealing with public representation in committees in the Knesset, meetings with MKs and ministers, municipalities and government ministries in order to promote the rights of the deaf and disabled on many issues. In many areas such as: State recognition of the deaf as disabled, access to government buildings, increasing employment of the disabled in the public and private economy, increasing benefits for the disabled and deaf, etc .. And currently, branches have been established throughout the country and abroad, and the association volunteers: professors, lawyers and auditors From its inception until today, all members of the association work voluntarily and all expenses of the association are financed from their own pockets. For this reason, the association decided to work for the receipt of section 46 (approval from the tax authority that allows donors to be taxed). Taxes that it is not possible to receive section 46 as long as there is no minimum income for the association in the amount of NIS 30,000 per year (in money or products). Therefore, as part of our efforts to raise donations, we decided to publicly call for the required amount of money. For more information - 054-4219131.",2

Knowledge of history and words of wisdom and clean language will not hurt, my family and I wish for the day that our head will be crowned with success.",0
"What is this nonsense ? There is no doubt that everything you have written is net politics. You are the president of a Jewish state and you wish good luck to a couple who are destroying Judaism? Your claim that this is racism is so untrue but you had to align with the left that controls the media. You're barely a month on the job and you've already humiliated us. You will reset yourself, you are the president of the State of Israel, after all, it is the state of the Jews. Halas quotes Jabotinsky. You will start quoting Sages or the Bible. So I wish the new couple that with God's help she would escape from him before he got pregnant because he married her. She must live in hell. But we are Jews and we will save her because that is our job. You have nothing good to say about the Jewish people. Just shut up and do not support assimilation.",1

"Honorable President, I am glad that you are the President of the State of Israel, and I wish you the best of blessings and best wishes. Yesterday you raised a status that caused me sorrow and heartache that the President of the Jewish State gives his blessing to the assimilation of a holy daughter of Israel here in the Holy Land. The honor of our sacred teachings precedes all democracy, because it is the one who has preserved us as the eternal people that sets us apart from all other peoples. Unfortunately, this is a phenomenon found among our Jewish brethren who tied their lives in the Diaspora. What will his nephews say in the Diaspora? I am so sorry, Mr. President, that I have found it appropriate and necessary to write to you. Hello and congratulations, Your Honor",1

"Peace to the Holy People of Israel. We are going through a difficult period, especially the bereaved families. It is difficult to say but, thanks to these holy sons, the people were privileged to unite and unite. God desires our unity and our love for others and mutual guarantee. It is said that thanks to the righteous women we were redeemed from Egypt and thanks to them will also be redeemed in the coming redemption upon us for good and we will see our heroes back among us alive. Wonderful mothers and wives, exemplary Jewish families, the sanctification of such a name no doubt made a noise and left a great impression in heaven. Confidence in the name and acceptance of the terrible and irrevocable decree and the understanding of the plan - this is what drives the ignorant gentile flesh and heart out of his mind. Such a belief confers many rights on the whole people. Dear Jews, the time of our redemption is coming. It's time to act. We must begin to keep the scripture. When we keep the scripture God will fight for us. Anyone who thinks he belongs to a ""Palestinian people"" is of the seed of toil. It must be killed. We need a rehabilitation leader and will fight Amalek until his general destruction. And if we do not have such a leader in this government - it must be replaced. Stupid and thinking as a sole to define Hamas as the source of the problem and fight against it. This is a war on windmills. Hamas is the people and the people is Amalek. Even those who live among us or outside our borders who belong to this people - are of the seed of Amalek. We have no problem with Arabs, we have a problem with Amalek. God did not command us to make peace with him but to destroy him. This is the commandment of the name and anyone who thinks otherwise is wrong and deceives himself. This people is forced to do good: they could have developed and lived by our side in peace for over 60 years and enjoyed a normal life, full of abundance and all good, but they chose to fight us - just like Amalek. We call on Stan - a friend and partner for peace Abu Mazen - a seven-faced snake and prostitute who did his doctorate on Holocaust denial. What is the difference between the Nazis, their name and memory will be erased, and Amalek of the Palestinian people today? No difference the difference is that today we are, so to speak, stronger than them, but in fact, the opposite is true, they are stronger than us and systematically kill us. God wants a decisive and wise people. No king would want his son to act like a rag when he needed to demonstrate authority and determination and leadership. Similar to a woman what kind of woman would want a husband who acts like a female who cries for her and complains instead of solving problems. When there is unity and a spirit from the people, everything is blessed, especially in situations that threaten us: Get up and kill him as soon as possible. May we be blessed that in the head of our country there will be a true leader that our enemies will fear from us even after many years after he joins our ancestors. So if we want to gain appreciation and respect we have to act accordingly. The leader will soon be revealed in Gd - our job is to demand it. We have been redeemed in Nissan and will be redeemed in Nissan.",1
I agree with every word,0
"It seems like it is easy to judge Maccabi Tel Aviv for racism. But for more years it carries a racist flag, does it pass you by, Mr. President? Maybe because you are a fan more, so it is easier for you to come to Maccabi with complaints, than to look at what is happening in your stands.",1
To all writers,0
One such picture is worth a thousand words!,0
The right man in the right place in Jerusalem success,0
"Mr. Next President, there are judges in Jerusalem who are the fifth corps, in the Knesset there is a government of zeros, cowardly rags and in the Knesset there are small, cowardly and submissive Jews.",1
Show me an Arab married to a Jew is the thing with them it is murder for the honor of the family. Why can they maintain this separation and with us not. They can live wherever they want anywhere in the country and we do not.,1
He did not say what he really thinks .. I'm sure of that. And if so then why interfere at all then it's a private event no? But he chose to continue in Peres' way. That Jews are murdered then silent and spray-painted graffiti then make a pilgrimage to the village. It would have been better not to interfere here or here. He loves the Land of Israel is great but why did we come here? If this is the result .. that a president encourages assimilation? !,1
You were elected and became a leftist? Bibi was right,1
Good luck tomorrow and for the next seven years.,0
Behind every good president stands a woman like you successfully the only Ruby who fits.,0
So human so adorable!,0
Ruby's mistake is no longer a Jewish state. You have long since abandoned the values ??of Judaism,1
Shhhhhhhh: You deserve the honor of President Robbie Rivlin ??,0
It is a wonder in His honor that you are thus encouraging assimilation among the people,1
"Mr. Netanyahu thought he was saving a life in the bloody Shalit deal, but unfortunately more and more people in Israel are paying with their lives for Rahala's fatal mistake.",1
Robbie Rivlin who has been waiting for where you came from is okay for me you are not a president anymore maybe on the other side I wish I would ever rehabilitate a real man without such and such populist touches who would say it as a real Jew according to the opinion of his ancestors,1
"Listen bro, you live in a movie ... unemployed, not working, smoking ... Tell me a little bit about who you are in general, who you are in general and what? I wish your girl to marry an Arab ... fucked child",1

I have a dream to ride the light rail in Jerusalem without being thrown Molotov cocktails on it to sleep quietly at night in bed without hearing explosions and shots,1
"I have not heard any incitement. Revelations of incitement means a call to harm them or any of their relatives in any way .... Although I did not cooperate with calls to oppose their marriage or to persuade the girl to change her mind or share her poor father's words to her or to demonstrate and so on. Because it's a business cell to interfere in nobody's life. But I am really against assimilation, I was properly educated and there is no chance that I and any of my family members will do so (no matter what their origin and religion). Avoiding assimilation is really not racist !!! Your right to choose with whom you want to live a life together, we all make a million and one considerations in choosing a life partner, most of us mostly rely on cold considerations like livelihood profession etc. Religion, nationality, culture, heritage and mentality are no less important if not more so.",1
"The face has changed, but the voice is the voice of reward. Are you sane? He is a Muslim, the enemy of the Jewish people. Are you talking about incitement? And what about what is happening here in Israel and the incitement of the Muslims to destroy Israel? Have you heard of Hanin Zoabi? Does Yitzhak incite in your presidential opinion? You might ask the same Muslim who would also allow his sister to marry a Jew and convert and then hear his opinion on incitement, love and racism. Excuse me for saying this, but be ashamed. You are not presenting now what you presented when you asked to be elected. Apparently power does corrupt.",1

Shameless dog Arab girl Ashraf you,1
"The culture of ""nearby will be fine"" also in the national sense. History and reality teach us that the Jewish people have a dangerous suicidal tendency to prefer temporary tranquility and temporary economic well-being and momentary enjoyment in the present, while falling asleep, closing their eyes and ignoring warnings about the dangers of the future and when the Jewish people remember it may sometimes be too late. Wise.",1

"Honorable President Shalom,, offers you not to take sides and if you decide to express a position it is your duty to condemn both sides,,, violence is celebrated because the Arabs of Israel did not stop rejoicing and rejoicing when our dear soldiers were killed,, our duty to preserve their dignity as their duty to protect us !!!! I will remind you that Maccabi Haifa played in Austria, they were attacked by anti-Semites, the same Arab player chose to flee and not take sides !!! From here the rupture started we all realized they are not really part of us and everything is playing !!",1
The right choice for the right man.,0
... Blessings in Cubanism .... The nodder answered our prayers and the wish of our son ....! Honor to the new President of the State of Israel !!! st,0
I have no dialogue with anyone who agrees to a Jewish marriage with an Arab. You are not our president.,1
Shabbat Shalom Reuven The most accepted president in Israel has risen and success The Amor family loves you very much,0
Damnle Damn President Where are your Jewish values ??you do not represent us! I despise you damn,1
"Enough with that, we are not shouted antisemitic chants, it is long over, stones and Molotov cocktails are being thrown at us. This will be condemned by Mr. President.",1
We have no other country.. Long live the President of the State of Israel,0
"Honorable President, I appreciated you as a politician and thought you would be a great president and it turns out I was right. Align power over integrity values ??and courage.",0
It was clear to me that we would be elected president! You're just the one who fits it! Honorable President-elect: Good luck in everything you do and succeed!,0
"I think people got a little confused here .. with who she chooses to marry is a private matter and maybe I do not agree with it but after all no one would make such a story from the couple if he was not an Arab. Let's say that if a Jew had married an American Christian they would not have turned the country upside down like this! Some proportions please as long as she is not your sister or your mother you will take care of your own affairs! She has been with him for 5 years, converted to Islam for him, this is her choice and her problem !!!!! Everyone makes their choices we do not have to agree. And with the honor of speaking out like that against the honor of the President just a shame !! We have more urgent things to deal with than a girl who fell in love with an Arab.",1
I also think and hope that the next president is Ruby - holding fingers and wishing success,0
"One should simply distinguish between racism and incitement to violence for which there is no place at all, and an act that harms us as a Jewish people, tends to harm the tradition that brought us to be what we are and such an act deserves to be condemned. Just as every person has the ability to fill swastikas around him, but it is an act that does not conform to morality .. There are acts that are legally permissible but morally have no place, and for that the understandable pain of anyone who rebels against it, only violence and incitement is something unrelated Does not belong at all to the fact that we are Jews.",1
"Ruby Are you ready for your daughter to be your granddaughter? You will marry if an Arab. I believe not then, Your Honor. I do not think you should interfere in this sensitive issue.",1
Good luck to you,0
Just not being Netanyahu's accompanying star was you! Man of Jerusalem and the Greater Land of Israel !!!,0
I am really excited to be with you and wish you success - and Shabbat Shalom from Rishon Lezion ...,0
"I also understand that you feel in the test but the people behind you you do not have to prove to anyone that you are worthy, stick to your true mentality or at least be fair to everyone !!!",1

Congratulations to the State of Israel. You have won a worthy president ??,0
Dear and beloved man! There could not be a more suitable person than you for this honorable position. You are a unique person and it excites me time and time again to remember the Independence Day ceremony in which you were the Speaker of the Knesset. Your excitement at these ceremonies was contagious and it was this that made me realize how special you are. May God keep you in all your ways!,0
"Itamar Biton So sorry, if it's because of the way I wrote - sorry, this topic disgusts me and I'm with all these far right people on my Facebook and believe me seeing the conversations between them is repulsive",1
One should beware of assimilation. Do not encourage and approve in the name of democracy,1
"Love you . You will know that the very concession in time to Shimon Peres and in addition the blessing of Rabbi Ovadia, are what brought you to greatness. In the shadow of the Lord",0
Exciting,0
Shabat Shalom to you too,0
"Painful, sad, outraged, may his memory be blessed",0
You have a special light ... God is with you ..,0
"Our dear President. Even in office as president, one must have the courage to say what the people think. To encourage and not to condemn the daughters of Israel, who marry Arab Muslims, is a red line for the Jewish people who have maintained their Judaism for thousands of years. The phenomenon of Arabs wanting to harm the Jewish people has found a way to humiliate us in an attempt that, unfortunately, sometimes succeeds in misleading Jewish girls. One should not be ashamed to really say what the left does not like to hear. I think we should be resolute and say in a wavy bristle that the Jewish people must guard against such phenomena.",1
Need to gain sympathy from the hippie,0
President of Kowloom. The living conscience. The father of all the inhabitants of the country. We hope for stability and continuity in your positions and opinions for freedom of expression and freedom. And equality in the sentences.,0
"I am against incitement and racism It is a pity that they do not start with Gideon Levy Hanin Zoabi Ahmad Tibi, they set a good example of racism that the police will stop, so maybe the racists on the other side will be afraid",1
Mr. Rivlin. Go to work. The city and the country are on fire with a wave of hatred and racism. Your best friends for Meridor and Livni have been silenced. The gravel is spilled and the stench is terrible. Please do something before destruction.,1
The Rivlin loan would have been better for you to shut up. On this was said a sage for wisdom and silence. Apparently there was a mistake in electing the president. This has been proven for several days after you were elected. But I tell you that many will say that these are nonsense that infuriates and irritates anyone who has a Jewish soul in his nose. Woe to you and woe to those who hear your foolish words. Contempt for you You shame the institution of the presidency from now on Know that you do not represent many others and me too.,0

"Keep dreaming, as time goes on the Arabs just hate us more and we continue to give them a stage and rights until one day they make a move on us. Not to mention what is going on in Europe and the rest of the world in terms of Islam. Do you also want to give them what we have left? You probably learned that in order to get on stage in this country you have to turn left at an intersection.",1

If one of your children were to marry an Arab or an Arab woman you would really be supportive. This hypocrisy of any president or Knesset member is simply outrageous and shows the public exactly how fickle the Knesset members are and take care of their interests. If you were a role model and a strong character you would oppose it. Let them hear your true opinions. Or you just would not interfere.,1

"Mr. President ! Why are you only addressing Jews regarding racism and nationalism? .. Please address on behalf of all of us to the Arab leaders in the country who will stop the shift and hatred towards us. At the head of their leaders are the smart demagogues in the Knesset who are fueling hatred between Jews and Arabs here in Israel. Do not accuse us of racist behavior, this behavior follows the violence and hatred of the few in the Galilee, Wadi Ara and the Negev, Jaffa, Lod, Acre and East Jerusalem towards the Jews in Israel. Put things on their accuracy instead of preaching morality to us and threatening us all by legal means. You are the president of us all and we do not want to go to dark places. Therefore, Mr. President, you will invite the Arab wise men (some or all of whom were absent from the Knesset on the day of your election to the presidency) to bring down the flames of hatred between us and us.",1

"The Jewish people and the Chinese people at about the same age. There are close to a billion and a half Chinese in the world despite the birth control limit. In my opinion the conclusion is pretty clear that assimilation is a fatal blow throughout the ages. This is in addition to all the extermination journeys we have made throughout history, and sent us into exile, and forcibly transferred many Jews to their religion which is also a form of assimilation. Just thinking back on everything we went through is a miracle that there were any Jews left at all. And how can some fools give thanks to God and their fathers who have hardened their souls and have not assimilated until now? Marrying Gentiles and willingly converting to their religion! Only a ignorant Jew who does not understand what gift he received as a Jew was born, despises his Judaism like that",1

"Dear Rivlin, Your words are appreciated, but not enough ... The Land of Israel has always been a place where you can express your views openly, unfortunately lately, there is real fear and terror among citizens, fear of expressing our opinions, or living according to our beliefs, fear that characterizes totalitarian states, From which our relatives fled two generations ago. The attack on a couple who wants to get married, as in any democratic country, is a sign of a broader and more worrying phenomenon that reads here. There are organizations that work here, and cast terror and terror beyond condemnation. It is time to act ... to prosecute anyone who threatens, silences, silences ... prosecute Anyone who acts and personally attacks bodies and places just because of their political opinion. It's probably just a barren appeal that you will not even read ... but it's a desperate call from a citizen, once our threat was external, for the first time I feel threatened by the citizens of my country ...",0

President We really appreciate you but there is a big but if there is no change or law against Israeli Arabs who raise the Palestinian flag and demonstrate against our soldiers who also guard them and they get social security from the state and live a life that freedom will explode in our face we ask you to do action we are not against The Arabs of Israel are against us and it is dangerous to sit with you in the Knesset against Israel like Tibi and like Zubi for your prompt treatment.

Shame on you . As a Jerusalemite and as someone who supported you - I am disappointed in you. Ready to sell the values ??of Judaism and support assimilation just to maintain a state image ?? That is why you were chosen as the President of the State of Israel ?? If you did not understand that you were expected and expected to replace Peres not only in the Tabernacle but also the spirit that ministered in it - do yourself and us a favor and resign. One prize was already more than enough!,1

"** Especially for you Honorable President - ** Article: ""What is really the difference between racism and assimilation"" ""? The difference between them is like the difference between heaven and earth. And if I am against the assimilation and interference of the people of Israel, does that mean I am racist and immoral ???? , I have gentile friends and I respect them, and help them, and for full equality between all, and coexistence and everything is good and excellent among us all, so I am very surprised at those wise and prudent people who say if you do not agree that your sister will marry the gentile who fell in love with him then You are a racist, what nonsense and nonsense, there are certain boundaries that I have to keep just like: in school, in the army and at home that I am not allowed to do and even if the world explodes it is against the rules and laws that accepted me into the army or school To do in the same place, what is so hard to understand, a little sad and sad for me all these comparisons, it is just shame and disgrace that we are dealing with this nonsense and vanity, which feeds us, and the people of Israel have to endure it, at a time when lies became truth and truth became lies. Our eyes to it. As it is written in the Psalms: """" They are poor and will not see ears and no Hear .. """" There is a state of assimilation and mixing and God forbid the disappearance of Israel and there will be no uniqueness of the people of Israel that the same Jewish people represent to the whole world and in fact all Jewish holidays, Sabbaths, Jewish celebrations, all Jewish events and everything will actually be erased, and it must not happen. Not only to the people of Israel but also to the nations of the world, which we as a nation and as a people have given to the whole world the recognition of Gd and that there is a Creator for creation, and all the various customs that accompany it, so it is inconceivable that the source of all this be erased from the map. """" There is a terrible assimilation, so at least in the Holy Land it is our duty to keep and avoid it) because in the end, at the end of the correction of the world as it is written: """" Isaiah) """" that everything depends on Israel and what is happening in the whole world """" (the Zohar), that everything actually happens because of the actions of Israel and therefore our moral and global duty, not only personal to maintain our borders and uniqueness as a people for all humanity to whom we grant it, so it is very important that we marry """" According to the religion of Moses and Israel """" which are the ones who instilled in us and us Drink the faith in one God, unique and special !! """,1
Not for incitement and not for violence without racism but yes to oppose marriage with Arabs,1
Ruby is not good. So what Anne said in a few words is actually transferring money to terrorists,1
"People's private life is not for anyone! , It's her choice and she's the one she'll have to deal with later in life !! Get off this issue, it's already ground endlessly! Assimilation exists all over the world and I have not heard you complain about what is happening in the US in France and the like,,,",0
That a president in the Land of Israel will give backing to assimilation ... This is itself a very serious rushing disease ... without beautification of the soul ... There is a Torah for the people of Israel before a morbid democracy that blurs the identity of the Jew.,1

"Rivlin quotes Jabotinsky to me lol Really a joke like a child in kindergarten. You will learn true Torah and you will see that assimilation is a great destruction for her family and the whole people of Israel. President of Israel quotes Jabotinsky for me on the Torah. What happened to Rivlin? M., Ibn Ezra, Ramchal, Rabbi Shimon Bar Yochai and others as great as them. Or probably the Honorable President did not have time to check whether a Jew is allowed to marry a Gentile?",1

"Yes Ruby, does it make sense to you to meet with Abu Mazen at a time when the Prime Minister has ordered an end to the meetings and talks with the PA due to the unification with Hamas ?? Abbas said ... Did he actually translate that and dismantle the union with Hamas? Has he stopped paying salaries to Hamas terrorists in prison? Abu Mazen is a terrorist. One of the initiators of the murderous attack in Ma'alot and a well-known Holocaust denier. He does not stop inciting against Israel in the PA's education system and in glorifying the terrorists. If you meet with him before you start serving as president, it shows how you will act as president - exactly the same as Shimon Peres ... a president who tries to wing Netanyahu on the left ... The national chose you ...",1
What are you doing against 56 percent assimilation data in the US?,1
A humble man with success,0
"Mr. Ruby Rivlin you made a point mistake. My wife and I and friends were happy and expected and apologized for your choice. But in this statement you are just disappointing and big, and even at this time that Muslims hurt us and kill us you cover and go out against people fighting assimilation you were silent and not express opinion You will be seen as a representative of why you did not come out against the racism of the Muslims who kill Jews on purpose just because they are Jews",1

For those who say we mixed with the peoples therefore Jews came from everywhere in the world it is a lie !!! and a lie !!! The Jews in the world kept themselves from mixing and lived in the ghettos were educated like you Who said to love and got married to Gentiles what is left of them no one knows ... 3. The great Torah scholars and sages of the generation (not Ben Gurion and Herzl who among the fools used to call them """" sages of the generation """") said that the Holocaust came because there was tremendous assimilation and data of 60 % Or more ... what to do you annoyed Gd ... another little thing ... For someone who thinks that Gd is primitive and does not encourage love he is wrong ... Gd is love in its embodiment once he says to keep mitzvos and people do not keep he can destroy the world in an instant But no ... he loves humanity! Gd foresaw that he was having ""love"" problems with our enemies so he said to expel the peoples who were here 3000 years ago (to Palestinians) so that we do not encounter them ... why do you think alone they do evil in the eyes of Gd working for other gods ... that their work was probably one of the most stinking for those who have learned and know what it is ... they will miss us and our daughters and sons and Gd does not want the people That he chose him to mingle with other Gentiles ... lacking Jews? Missing conversions? No then start working! Gd commands us to marry whoever does not marry is a transgression we are commanded to love our wives as our body and respect them more than our body unlike Islam ... that a woman is an object that is used and thrown in the trash ...

Now that all the garbage leftists and the whole right have left all 7 million Jews and will simply overthrow this shitty government that does not worry us neither in security nor in livelihoods nor in apartments now is the time to hit the roads to block all of Israel from Eilat to Tel Aviv and just overthrow our shitty government,1

It's time to dump her and move on. And clarify again the limits of expression that not everything is freedom of expression. The majority of the public in the country rejects and despises racist incitement.,1

"Before 16 (I am a veteran in the country) I took paid 4,000 NIS for driving lessons, and did not pass the first test. I took more lessons for the second test but the money was not enough to take more lessons and then I stopped. Today exactly the same thing happened to me. Today the legal situation is even more difficult for people in a difficult financial situation like mine because dependence on an internal test causes all driving instructors to submit the student to an external test based on considerations of financial greed that first of all they try to spend as much money as possible on driving lessons. Still not ready ""that she's an excuse that the law recognizes as legal and that's a problem because it's being abused and spurs driving instructors to be greedy for students' money just like a loophole calling for a thief. Students 'dependence on teachers' ""considerations"" should be eliminated, and just as it is possible to approach a theoretical test when the student feels he is ready for it, so too in the practical driving test who should choose the timing to approach is the student and not someone who receives money from the student for Additional driving lessons depend on the teacher's ""discretion"" who ""believes"" that the student is not yet ready for the external test. The negligent law that exists today that hangs the student's timing to take an external test in the driving instructor hurts first and foremost people with very low incomes who can not continue to pay for additional driving lessons and get stuck even without a chance to do a second test, even without a driver's license and stuck with bigger expenses in advance. Driving lessons taken. I am currently stuck with no money to pay for more driving lessons, but in the coming months my bank account will be paid for the checks I gave to the driving school, and I am well known in the welfare bureau. Just yesterday I received from my social worker a social report to receive food from an association whose manager replied that only in September would they be tested whether to help me with food once a month. My monthly income is NIS 3,000, known and recognized by the National Insurance Institute due to functional limitations and despite the limitations I still work hard. But my only income is as stated NIS 3,000, and from it I have to pay rent, electricity, water, property taxes and expenses and always be preoccupied with surviving when every month there are commitments for current expenses and this driving lessons were such expenses that at the end of the month I will have a hard time continuing to pay. I would like to offer you to propose an amendment or legislation aimed at making it easier for low-income earners to spend on driving lessons. My idea is that some of the people who want to enlist in the army (or national service) at a later age (e.g. 30 years old), and in the meantime will be drivers, are those who in the public service will take a driving instructor course and give driving lessons in their national service or service. The military. People who want to learn to drive and do not have money, will bring a certificate from a social worker on low income and will be able to receive unlimited driving lessons. For covering the state's expenses in parking vehicles and fuel, it is possible to charge each driving student only 10 NIS per driving lesson. In such a situation, the state will be able to facilitate people like me, the public will be able to get people to take driving lessons to drive carefully on the road and prevent road accidents, and also will be able to run such a low-income driving lessons service because they will be required to pay a reduced price for driving lessons. How about formulating this idea into a bill and submitting it to the Knesset? I would love to receive feedback on my idea and your willingness to promote it into a bill / amendment to the law. Lena """,2

"Monday - Good Week and Congratulations Elijah the Prophet Remember well in honor of the Prime Minister: If his honor is in the Land of Israel, on earth then the old news is actually: - Arabs kill an Arab and burn him (only an Arab knows where the victim is at 3 in the morning, at the entrance to a mosque , That no Jew will approach there, only an Arab who kills with many stabs and burns the victim so that there will be no evidence), and this is neither the first nor the last time.It is an art that these human animals often use, to accuse Israel of the world, and riot (they also take care not to burn There will be traces ... like the 3 children's vehicle.) And of course the police will not be able to decipher this murder for a long time, if at all, because these human animals will surely interfere with it and hide this shameful murder inside them, with the help of Oslo criminals and the deadly and submissive left. , Be'er Sheva, Netivot, Sderot, Yom Yom, Lila Lila ... - Stone-throwing riots all over the country, including our wounds and much destruction, fires, train stations used by these human animals in Jerusalem, buses and streets and shops ... Your left), narrow to internal insecurity, and from the police, and other Oslo criminals of all kinds: - We will catch the The murderers 'settlements (it is clear as day that this is Arab work, the main thing is to apologize even before an interrogation ... Oslo mentality again), blood is blood, murder is murder, the Jewish murderers' houses must also be destroyed ... The Arabs have trapped you again! If the cowardly and defeatist Jews admit that they murdered, then we have achieved the goal and we will start rioting !!! The whole world will see ... - The Likud's proposal for their homes: If there is silence, we will be quiet ... (the deadly and immoral Oslo mentality again). In other words, the Israeli government is begging for peace, on all fours, after the murder of our children, the shelling of our cities, and the rioting of these human animals every day ... - We will deploy iron domes, also in Modi'in and the central region ... - The slogans of defeat, shame and lethality , The situation needs to be calmed down, it is not wise to attack, it is forbidden to enter Gaza ...) At the height of the immorality and defeatism that the left is not ashamed to display, after thousands of Oslo murderers ... and the people of Israel hear and do not believe. Crying under a barrage of missiles (which have not yet reached Tel Aviv ... so no problem). Benjamin, how long is your role and our country despicable ?! The more you bow down, the more the enemy will riot and kill and shell ... You will start behaving like the Prime Minister of Israel, from the head and not the belly, and you will kill and kill and destroy without mercy and without hesitation any enemy raised against us, in Gaza, inside occupied Israel (Ramallah, Hebron, East Jerusalem ... ) And everywhere! You said ""Get up early to kill him"" ""! But in practice the Likud their homes do the opposite ... release murderers, again the nasty and immoral Oslo slogans ... and you are paralyzed! It is better to resign as a leader, than to beg these killers at every opportunity, and order the massacre and shelling The following are HH, for whom you are directly responsible !!! And the people of Israel are suffering ... How long will you wake up? We have no choice but to cry, to declare loudly in the face of the situation ""Only Ben David"".
