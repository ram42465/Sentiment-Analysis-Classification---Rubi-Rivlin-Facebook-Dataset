It really hurts ..... I cry with the family that you will not know any more grief,0
Our dear man,0
Well done and good luck,0
"Tel Hai, Ruby. In all this sadness you were a ray of light of hope. There is indeed a president in Israel",0
Clean hands and a hearty good luck to you and us.,0
Ruby Happy holiday and good luck in the presidential election.,0
The president does not shake hands. Enough of the brawl one can express an opinion and resist but not physically. It is her choice to marry a Muslim. We wish her success!,0
"Honorable President, there is nothing better for you in the world than to be the President of the State of Israel. The people of Israel love you and God loves you and you are an example and role model for every person.",0
"Congratulations to you, Mr. President, as a right-wing man, I think love will win.",0
"Mr. President, sorry for the bluntness, stop fucking the mind. To this day, you have not said a word about the situation in the country. You did not express your sympathy for the army. You did not say a kind and encouraging word to the people of the south. If Tisha B'Av is important to you, then go back in history and disappear from our sight.",1
Good luck Mr. President,0
And I still thought a normal president had arrived,1
The detached white president is smart to speak. He will not be there in the moment of truth to help her heal the terrible wounds she will receive. Detached and alienated from his people. I despise him.,1
"A successful way in a stormy sea !!! Believes that you will continue to behave as you did when you were Speaker of the Knesset, with integrity and enlightened liberalism, and detached from the political swamp ...",0
Dear Robbie Rivlin !! Are you a family man?,1
You Deserve !!!!,0
Amen,0
"Wow exciting! With the help of God, the President of the State of Israel !!",0
Not another week in the job and you already forgot where you came from?,1
Successfully,0
Mr. President . If democracy and the future of coexistence are important to you do an act and go be a guest of honor at this wedding.,0
"Rivlin I just deleted you, how much I loved you for it was said ""Sage for Wisdom Silence"" """"",1
If there's anyone who deserves it it's you..good luck,0
Get started !! Another coward! Cahana Was Right,1
"Honorable President, I was not happy on the day of your election, I did not think I would hear Shimon Peres from your throat so quickly,",1
"With the comments written here, you have a lot of work to do as president, good luck!",0
Ruby ... one joke a week ... the people of Israel need an occasional smile.,0
"The honor of the next president is upon us for good. Happy for your future meeting with Abu Mazen, ask him to explain how it fits in with any arrangement: The Palestinian Authority pays salaries to terrorists imprisoned in Israel every month. Every month. You don't just pay, you pay well: you murder more -> you sat longer -> you got more money ** A terrorist who is a lecturer for five to ten years earns NIS 4,000 a month. A terrorist who lectures for 10-15 years earns NIS 6,000 a month. A terrorist who has been serving for 25-30 years, earns NIS 10,000 a month. And the heaviest terrorists, the most cruel murderers, sentenced to more than 30 years, receive NIS 12,000 a month. (Barghouti, for example) ** In addition, every Palestinian prisoner imprisoned in Israel receives NIS 400 for private expenses twice a year. There is also a supplement for those who are married and a special supplement for children. ** In Palestinian terms, this is a huge salary. ** About 4,000 released prisoners continue to receive salaries after their release. ""Preferred work"" also has a pension. ** So did Ziad Awad, the late Baruch Mizrahi killer who was released in the Shalit deal, received a salary from the Palestinian Authority in the first prison, was released and received a salary from a released terrorist, and now his ""conditions"" will be raised in Abu Mazen's preferred job: he is a murderer A Jew and returned to prison. Amazing . """,1
"By the time you publish the post. The poor and needy bride got up in the morning and received and one presidential encouragement. Maybe she still had an answer pondering. But such a seal for a poor girl without a spine ... you may have tilted the spoon. Honorable President, in any case, these messages will be read to you when your day comes ... in the hope that you will have time to get an answer by then. Poor man like you",1
"Honorable President, well done, I support your every word.",0
Honorable to the Honorable President.,0
"Our dear President. Even in office as president, one must have the courage to say what the people think. To encourage and not to condemn the daughters of Israel, who marry Arab Muslims, is a red line for the Jewish people who have maintained their Judaism for thousands of years. The phenomenon of Arabs wanting to harm the Jewish people has found a way to humiliate us in an attempt that, unfortunately, sometimes succeeds in misleading Jewish girls. One should not be ashamed to really say what the left does not like to hear. I think we should be resolute and say in a wavy bristle that the Jewish people must guard against such phenomena.",1
"May his memory be blessed, how sad",0
Dye for silence Dye !!!,1
Successfully !!!,0
President without travel,0
"Mr. President, I hope you will consider pardoning Mr. Katsav. I am sure and believe that he did not do such things, even if a court ruled that a judge was also guilty.",0
"So glad that the right choice was made, Robbie Rivlin you are the most suitable person for the position of President of the State of the Ten Commandments.",0
"Thank you Your Honor, this is a dream of us all. Thank you for expressing it on our behalf and thank you to my lovely daughter who brought your words here.",0
Behind every successful man there is a loving and supportive woman!,0
"You are no longer my president, you encourage assimilation so you have no uniqueness as the president of the Jewish people, Shabbat Shalom",1
"well done ! Adds respect to the institution of the presidency and to the eroding honor of the State of Israel, in a clear, strong and unequivocal statement against racism. Not only Jabotinsky promoting moral truth in this, but that we also read the book of Genesis: ""this one book of the generations of mankind"" ""- leaving on Bra god man, Bdmot god Ash He him, in male and Nkbh Bram, and Ibrc Atm, Leviticus At-Smm man leaving on Habram """". """,0
Does he already have a foreign country passport ???,1
Not another week in the job and you already forgot where you came from?,1
The right man in Mac for the people of Israel is good for Jerusalem at last and the right man is good,0
"You have a smile that conquers the entire State of Israel, Your Honor.",0
President of the State of Israel Kalbavi. Straighten power !!,0
"Well spoken ! Proud of you, Robbie! President of the State of Israel!",0
Sing Alec ?? First rummage through your actions !!!! It remains to be seen how long she will remain president.,1
"Mr. President, I also wish you a happy and quietest New Year. A year in which you will not tweet any nonsense.",1
"Now that they know who the kidnappers are to go to the family homes and just put everyone but everyone in jail without giving them any privilege and announce that they will be released when our righteous sons are released because ""in Rome you will act like a Roman"" ""Let's see the scoundrels know this is the way !!!!! """,0
Ruby I would like to see an Arab marry a Jew,1
Beautiful picture-Shefu,0
A kind of boycott must be made when reporters who hate Israel go on air should broadcast to another channel and then you will see what the power of the ratings will do (in the context of Rina Matzliach's words),2
Ophir just for the fact that like you the president wrote his words,0
Shabbat Shalom Mr. Sir:),0
All this security budget and technology and there is no deterrent against the bombing terrorists do not know what? Thoughtful accountants What will the world say should act fast and strong that even the world will sometimes think that with the Jews and Israelis not to bother Bibi and Lieberman and Bennett you will start acting like brave customs and not bomb empty warehouses !!,1
100 percent right each and his choice,0
"Good luck, straight force",0
Shabbat Shalom !,0
Jerusalemite. Asli. You are our president and there is no situation that you will not be elected. We believe my sons believe in success dear man.,0
G. bless you Mr. Reuven Rubi Rivlin:),0

Good luck to the people of Israel ... and to you,0
Bengi Rivlin Family ??,0
charming,0
Long live our new president for the honor and glory of the State of Israel,0
Why is this a confusion of mind?,1
"The Knesset chose the people's election. The residents of Dimona wish you great success, health and strength, stay sensitive and exciting, with a sense of humor and values ??of friendship and loyalty!",0
"To our new president, thank you for your moving words, now the most important thing is to calm the discourse - the abusive one that is common among us and talk about calming the harsh and abusive words that are flying everywhere",0
A man from a family who built neighborhoods outside the wall,0
Honorable President I disagree with you I wish them days of suffering that they will never have one happy day in their life and in God also they will not have children who did not know contentment in their life !!!!!! Our soldiers are fighting and being killed for the country and this garbage is marrying an Arab I definitely wish her grief and suffering all her life !!!!! ????,1
Health Honorable President. Go to the grandson of your family and all the people of Israel,0
Successfully !!,0
Only according to this post do you see how much you deserve the title of honorary president Reuven (Ruby) Rivlin ..,0
Keep your mouth dirty !!!! And honor the president and if not the president honor a person older than you. I'm sure that's not how she is raised from home.,1
"what are you saying ? Really? I signed up for an Eddie card 20 years ago, so it's good to remember just now!",1
Of blessed memory,0

Honorable President Mazal Tov up to 120 Proud and your fan For many years you will be blessed to have success in your job !!!,0
Not only does the grandson love you too with Yisrael. We wish success in the job for longevity in good health.,0
"Dumb and hypocritical president, I wish your granddaughters an Arab groom a shoe",1
"Guy, you're a stupid, stupid kid who's not educated on the knees of Judaism, probably your father is raving about energy ... or your mother is a Muslim or the mistress of a Muslim father.",2
President Rivlin loves you,0
"Mr. President, tonight you will hear a lament about the State of Israel that you will not begin to treat this minority properly. It will be destroyed. You will continue to listen to the world and not to the Jewish people. We will not be here for long enough mercy enough foolishness enough stupidity enough your dreams and fantasy about peace. We or they",1
"Congratulations Ruby! A humble, pleasant man who knows how to move and get excited, a man of the Greater Land of Israel! There is no one more worthy of you, no more suitable of you! Who will give and give you God health and success to fulfill the role! Long live the President of the State of Israel! Long live! Long live! Long live!",0
Well done to this dear president. Such a short time in office and all his statements to this day pay homage to the position.,0
Amen,0
"Successfully ! I was very happy today to hear that you are the next President of the State of Israel. God bless you and keep you. May the LORD lift up his countenance upon thee, and give thee rest. The LORD lift up his countenance upon thee, and give thee peace. And put my name upon the children of Israel, and I will bless you.",0
I am also very right-wing and think that every person's decisions should be respected .. but it is good that there is this protest and demonstration that the Jewish girls or young girls will understand the problem here .. if they save one Jewish woman it is worth everything!,1
The ideal president for a democratic Jewish Israel.,0
It hurts and depresses my heart with Gila,0
"Shabbat Shalom to you, only you are worthy and will be our president",0
Congratulations and lots of success in the President's House. Love you Ruby,0
Painful and mourning with the families for the murder of the boys who were taken at their own expense.,0
"The heart is broken, how sweet and lovely !! ú.ð.ö.á.ä",0
Well done ! But why until now did you not have ??,0
Good luck dear friend thank you for your loyalty to the country and love of country,0
The first Betar president is Tel Hai,0
Honorable President Reuven Rivlin Thank God we have a president like you.,0
Wait .. if we were assimilated as early as 2000 years ago when the Romans exiled our parts ... would not that have prevented all this rush?,1
Long live the President of the State of Israel.,0
100 percent right each and his choice,0
A sad day for the presidency and the state.,1
"So the sketch in ""Parliament"" that you participated in with Asi Cohen will be rewarded correctly:) You constantly take pictures of the grandchildren, the Honorable President:) """,0

I am Algerian and this is the first time I have heard anyone in occupied Palestine say the words are reasonable and do not call them racist and say to Jews who say death to Arabs tell them dissatisfaction and death to Zionists and Israeli intuitions Freedom to Palestine,1
"In all service, Jews fought against assimilation. There can be no situation in which the President of the State of Israel encourages assimilation, so it has lost the moral ground to be the President of the State of the Jews.",1
At a good time you deserve and wish you success the Honorable President-elect,0
You will already resign a clown,0
"The woman converted to Islam, so she is an Arab. Why does it have to bother someone !!!!! ????",1
Shabbat Shalom to the 10th President! The State of Israel has won !!,0
Even the President of the State of Israel refers to this wedding ??? Has the world gone crazy ??? This wedding is clearly not interesting! Every day Jewish girls fall into the trap of Arab Muslims all over the country! The coverage is unnecessary and the reference excites the matter and causes unrest! Let her do what she wants! Dumb is definitely dumb !!!,1
"Dear man, you have just entered your position and the next morning you were in Nahum Abli in the mourning family of a soldier who was killed.",0
Honorable President you are absolutely right very true !!!!,0
"Mr. President, when it comes to one of the existential dangers of the Jewish people no less than Hamas in Gaza. We must come out against it! And as President of the State of Israel, I would expect you to condemn this or at least not encourage it. After all, there was a discussion in the Knesset committee on the issue of assimilation into marriage to Muslims and how all these cases ended in the abuse of women and their children. I have no doubt that this will also be the end of this case.",1
"Shimon Yifrach I have quoted the words of Shimon Peres for you. See post. Before writing a post, it is advisable to check it carefully in the form of errors and carriers. There is nothing about Shimon Peres, the president, for example.",2
I wish you were the dear President Mr. Rivlin,0
A good week for the President of the State of Israel who comes in and knows his people and country and the feelings of the people beyond any doubt,0
Indeed exciting. I wish for all the couples,0
An amazing couple !!!,0
"Honorable President, I also have a lot of dreams, until the alarm clock destroys them for me ??",1
The Honorable President did not have to say anything about assimilation and congratulations. Because you are leaving a way to break into assimilation. That God is saved,1
Well done honest power and I wish everyone would sign an Eddie card and then many people will be able to live much longer and their son my husband who is waiting for a heart transplant and we pray they will be able to save him before it is too late,0
Shabbat Shalom Mr. President Who will give and the boys will return in peace,0
prayers,0
"Salutes the President of the State for his clear and sharp words. Supports you full support. And for those who think that human dignity and basic rights are a matter for leftists, think again. Are you right-wing or racist fascists.",0
How sad ... little angel. My heart goes out to the family,0
Robbie Rivlin You will be elected tomorrow,0
"Ruby, after your words, it is difficult for me to call you the President of the State of Israel, I loved and supported you, but your words about the Jaffa couple hurt you severely. You humiliated yourself, even if you thought it was not necessary to express harm not only to yourself but also to the presidency.",1
"Keep being a cool grandpa, you'll never forget that!",0
Amen ..,0
"A beautiful cute boy does not deserve it like that. Congratulations, Reuven, for coming to him and accompanying him on his last beautiful journey on your part (y)",0
"Monday - Good Week and Congratulations Elijah the Prophet is well remembered in honor of the Prime Minister, well His Excellency wrote this week ""Our policy is simple, get up early to kill him ..."" "". Beautiful, almost accurate quotes from the sources. The source is """" coming to kill early to kill """" from the Gemara (Blessings of Noah 1: 2; 2: 2). There is no doubt that Benjamin, the Likud of their homes, will pay a very heavy price for the helplessness in security, the release of terrorists, surrender on the Temple Mount, Qassams and missiles every day (even tonight !!!), giving and giving, and now child abductions! Therefore, we ask you to act as Prime Minister of Israel, (and this does not mean to appear in the media and inform the people about the abduction, and in fact to thank the failure of your governments who bow to the enemy every day), that is: - to immediately resolve the failure of internal security, narrow Aharonovich His failures every day on the Temple Mount, and spitting on the people of Israel who pay him, and expelling Jews from the Temple Mount every day, the opposite of what he is supposed to do, expel terrorists and rioters! And now children are also being kidnapped in broad daylight! The people of Israel are not willing to pay for such a submissive failure not for one more second! And we would not rule out criminal action against him at all, by virtue of his responsibility! Decide to be the leader of Benjamin, otherwise the Likud Homes will pay a heavy price, and already pay! - To imprison any Arab leader in Hebron and of course any suspect immediately for interrogations, without visits of course, and if possible without meat and wine. Until the children are released at least. - Constantly attack Gaza and eliminate all Hamas leaders every day! Highly effective spot elimination, but every day! - Free Area C first from the Arab occupation, and prevent Arabs from entering the Temple Mount until the children are released. - Immediately repeal all Oslo agreements that are revoked, which the Oslo criminals will be prosecuted for. And they are already starting to pay ... - A power outage, water and fuel for evil in Gaza, Ramallah and all the territories occupied by the Arab terrorists invading in 48. - Give free permits for construction in the US, and increase the pace! And if you do so, you will succeed! Because this is exactly the policy of the Creator of the world, and this time Benjamin, the people will not forgive you for further subservience. """,1

Rivlin surprised us .. !!!! ?? President of the State of the Jews ??? Not a prize .. but Rivlin, it's shocking !!!!!!!!! On behalf of Jewish families in general and on behalf of bereaved families in particular ... I express my soul from the statements of the President of the State of the Jews (there is open terror that it is the enemies ... and there is quiet terror that it is by assimilation).",1
"It probably will not be ""the religion of Moses and Israel"" """"",1

Bibi and allow me only today to call you Bibi and not the Honorable Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu today we are all equal in our mourning, everyone is crying over this nasty disaster. 99% of the voters who voted for the Likud did so in the hope that the Likud will maintain our and our children's security more than any other party. In light of all the publications about the many omissions on the night of the abduction and the lukewarm response so far, there is no escape from admitting that you simply failed !!! You failed to release murderers. You have failed in that those murderers continue on their way without interruption. You failed to protect our children and you even failed to be notified of the abduction. The announcement today about the officers who will be fired is a joke. This story should be properly investigated and not shut me up in SAG ... I very much hope that tonight you will not be able to fall asleep in bed dozens of times and that in the morning Benjamin Netanyahu wakes up. And about the people of Israel in particular ... a night not so good for you and all the people of Israel.",1

"Dear friends, as someone who knows and cherishes the President of the State, acquaintance with the political system, I can assure you that he does not encourage assimilation on the contrary! But if a Jewish girl chose to convert to Islam and go into captivity after her Muslim core choice, what can the president of the state or any of us, even those of us who disagree or are satisfied with it, already say about it? One thing is clear in a democracy a person can do whatever he pleases and provided he does not harm another and does not break the laws of the state and even if his actions are not to my liking and do not conform to their worldview their blood is not allowed and so the president",0
proud of you ! The tenth President of the State of Israel!,0
"Honorable President, did you mention words like ""incitement"", """" racism """", which in my opinion also have no place in Israeli society. But is this really the picture? Incitement? Racism? Or is it an attempt to preserve the identity of the people of Israel and the Holy Torah? Here is a difference between an Arab or a Swede. A Jew or a Jew is not allowed to marry a Gentile. It can be called racism. But whoever says this, certainly has not learned even a little about the people of Israel and its uniqueness and its statement is from narrow vision and ignorance. To the State of Israel and probably also to the people of Israel. If indeed the people of Israel would go in the spirit of the things you said, and marry Gentiles, out of """" living together """", do you think you would be entitled to be president? Was there a Jewish state? The people of Israel """"? Or perhaps the people of Ishmael ... indeed, a moment of depression for the institution of the presidency, the State of Israel and the people of Israel. """,1

This is what happens that are far from the Torah. The Torah explicitly says if we do not expel them from the land they will be a mine for us!",1
Not pretty,1
Dear President. What about your Jewish spine? Have you seen all the movies about Israeli girls suffering and being raped after the wedding? Is this the coexistence you meant when you were sworn in as president? Will your granddaughter also allow you to marry an Arab ??,1
"Sammy, you're so right! Why did Bibi become silent in the face of the horrors of violent racism? Is he afraid that the rage of ""this is the people"" will ""turn against him? That it will become clear that he has no power to control the raging madness?""",1
Constantly participating in grief it does not help where the border is where the punishment and it should be disproportionate it is a Bordeaux line and they always cross another line when we do something they will bomb,1
"Maybe now you will understand that it is not great wisdom to be Shimon Peres. We all want peace but not at any cost. To meet with Abu Mazen and interfere in government policy is nonsense and a mistake. The more you are supported as soon as you become Shimon Peres, the public support for you will disappear. Do not want such a president.",1
Mazel Tov ! Continue the successful and dignified path of Shimon Peres. Long live,0
"With all due respect to coexistence. You should know that this report of existence is one-sided ... Do not marry Arabs because they know what respect is ... and with all due respect, who is racist here? They're at war and they're winning ... because we have dumb leaders.",1
It reminds me of the sketch in which Robbie Rivlin participated,0
"Jabotinsky is not the representative of God nor of all the partners in this country, what a person does in his home is his own business and no one has the right to raise a public protest about his actions !!!!!",1

"What a shame for President Reuven Rivlin trying to be an interesting democrat with it would happen in your home that your daughter or granddaughter were married to a gentile and above all an Arab with whom after marriage the woman is considered an inferior depressed object who will rape Muhammad's mental and physical morale Assimilation is what the Holocaust generation and the aliyah at the beginning of the settlement in Israel tried to prevent so that the Judaism that persecuted it in the world will grow and flourish not so that the daughters of Israel will convert to Islam and after being beaten in every way you will want and cry for help Because Israeli girls are allowed to marry an Arab and convert to Islam where your Jewish identity has not yet seen an Arab marry a Jew. You know why even before the ceremony she will be slaughtered by the honor of the Arab family who marry Jews, it is only to humiliate them, rape them and make them less Jewish.

Botinsky did not write the Torah. Shame on you for being the president of our people.",1

Recent. The state invests millions in Jewish education in order to stop the waves of assimilation in the Diaspora. What is happening in our country that hundreds of thousands of Jews are married to Israelis who hate Israel who want our extinction? And you speak in the name of democracy and love. Your words that seem to be stately are an encouragement to those girls who have not yet crossed the Jewish suicide line. To remind you that the Torah forbade the unification of Judaism with Gentiles, the Torah is still an educational and directed factor for the Jewish people.

"Yours sincerely Mr. Rivlin, I address you on behalf of retirees who have recently suffered from the new provision requiring them to present a senior citizen certificate to the driver, if the certificate is not in their possession the full price of the ticket is imposed on them. From France a copy of letters sent to Egged's public inquiries and it should be noted that they answered immediately and referred me to the Minister of Transport, from my experience I know that there is no point in contacting the Minister I address you as our beloved President in the hope that you can find an answer. In Haifa, at one of the stations, a very elderly woman, wrinkled and asked to pay for the trip, the driver approached her and asked her to present him with a senior citizen card, since the bus was traveling, and in order to get the ticket she had to hold the bag with both hands and look for the certificate. Is to fall if the driver stops abruptly, I turned to the driver and asked why he does not believe the woman? She told him that at the age of 85, the driver explained that this was a directive of the Ministry of Transportation and that he must obey or be fined NIS 5,000 because he had been criticized. I checked with Mr. Ziad from the Haifa Association and he verified this instruction. I asked, is there no room for driver discretion? After all, Egged drivers are intelligent enough to distinguish between an impostor and an old man, there is a thing called ""before the law"" ""I appeal to refresh the instruction that causes sadness to both adults and drivers. Hopefully common sense will work in this case, with great respect, Rachel Azaria , Chairman of the Pensioners' Committee, Board Member, and Mount Carmel Committee",2

"What a shame for President Reuven Rivlin trying to be an interesting democrat with it would happen in your home that your daughter or granddaughter were married to a gentile and above all an Arab with whom after marriage the woman is considered an inferior depressed object who will rape Muhammad's mental and physical morale Assimilation is what the Holocaust generation and the aliyah at the beginning of the settlement in Israel tried to prevent so that the Judaism that persecuted it in the world will grow and flourish not so that the daughters of Israel will convert to Islam and after being beaten in every way you will want and cry for help Because Israeli girls are allowed to marry an Arab and convert to Islam where your Jewish identity has not yet seen an Arab marry a Jew. You know why even before the ceremony she will be slaughtered by the honor of the Arab family who marry Jews, it is only to humiliate them, rape them and make them less Jewish.

Thank you, Mr. President. We in the Land of Israel no longer need Judaism. Do not need the religions do not need the Torah do not need the conservatives do not need the Sabbath do not need the ultra-Orthodox in short do not need with one but here need one society the land of the Jews does not interest anyone. Mr. President, perhaps at this time you have reached the kingdom if you are deaf to profit and rescue will come to the Jews from elsewhere. Is that all the dream he has? The dream of every Jew is to be a good player in this world, to build the people of Israel and the Torah of Israel and the Land of Israel. And in the building of the Temple we were like dreamers, we won the Land of Israel for the people of Israel who return to their land, but you want to erase the Torah of Israel in every way. What dream? Is this a Jew's dream? It was also the dream of the Greeks, they say all the arts came from the Greeks who no longer exist but the dream of this Jew was the dream of our ancestor Abraham who wanted to fix the world in the name of one in wisdom in believing in our patience Jewish nation . I believe that without the dream of football fields without any desecration of the Sabbath we will be privileged to fulfill the dream of every Jew that is the building of the Temple the building that will be built is the dream of every Jew also to be built soon nowadays Shabbat Shalom awaits the salvation of God.

"Honorable President. The right of every person to his dignity. In the case of intermarriage it is not racism. Our parents came to Israel with the thought that language is not a problem of assimilation and I understand the pain of the subject because the mountains of Israel are interdependent. On the other hand, it is clear that there is no room for incitement but information.",1

""During the Six Day War she did not win Israel to excess support from Britain. Its then foreign minister was a gentile named George Brown, one of the few people I heard whose anti-Semitism had some degree of understanding, if not justification. Why? Because the aforementioned George Brown married a Jewish woman I know the details of the story, because as a native of East London my late mother knew the woman's family. Mr. President, without referring to the couple in question, but as a general rule, intermarriage is cancer In the body of the Israeli nation. This is not my determination, this is acceptable in Israel for generations. You are wrong, Mr. President, when you mixed the issue of racism against Arabs - which I also strongly oppose - with the matter of intermarriage. I have no problem defending racism. Against Arabs. But in practice you have given a presidential seal to intermarriage, and thus, Mr. President, you are failing miserably. ""And"" ""marriage"" """" the same root, and I hope you will find a way to correct and clarify your position against intermarriage, to correct the defect in your presidency that your statement has caused. I wish you success throughout your tenure. """,1

Every Jewish person living among us today remains a Jew since about 3,600 years Passing by, generation after generation his ancestors took care to preserve the Jewish continuum, 3,600 years of marriage within the people or with converts, of preserving the heritage and tradition despite repeated attempts by different peoples (some of which became extinct themselves) to exterminate this wonderful people, 3,600 years, another generation A generation that was cut off in an instant ... Comparing the pain of the people to racism could instantly turn into a double-edged sword and retouch the Israeli tradition. The concept of racism is not part of the Israeli tradition that accepts and uplifts the Hagar - many descendants of Gerim serve as cornerstones in the Israel tradition - Rabbi Meir, Rabbi Akiva, King David ... - Honorable President, I believe that out of pain and fear that racism grows among the people you wrote what you wrote .. you have nothing to worry about the honor of the president, the people are not racist .. he is national!",1

The only red line I now know is your crossing in a red line and it is clear that a Jew is marrying a Jew and there is no Jew in the world who will atone for our Jewish daughters all the Gentiles. Maybe you Rivlin it does not bother because that Jew of yesterday is not your home so it is far from you. I cried like my sister was and my heart aches for her father's pain drinking blood from sadness. And you come out of nowhere and dare to wish good luck and dare to say that it is incitement on our part that we tried to save her. You are rude and your late father wanted you to be president but not for this result your father hoped not A son who flatters the Arabs in exchange for a chair that pads the ass and a salary of cream ... just shame and disgrace.,1

The box indicates simplicity and modesty. Where are the leaders of yesteryear ...,0
"Dear Ruby Abu Mazen in his speech at the conference spoke of returning the hostages but in the same breath he incited and ousted those present regarding Jerusalem. He claimed that Jerusalem would be snatched from them and soon it would be irreversible, he went on to say in a rather assertive tone that they could not face us alone and that the other peoples would come to help so why not talk about it ?? Why talk only about him calling for the abductees to be released? I feel it is a lie to the people with a determined forehead. We, for everyone, must know the enemy and not just look for how quiet it will be ...

The Honorable President may advance this proposal with a most shocking evening. And from that moment on the Knesset must enact a terrorist law or any other scum of a person who has murdered or is attempting to murder should be executed and not given VIP conditions as given in this fucking country. This is maybe how this will prevent the next kidnappings / murders !!! And he will have no murderers to release,1

"Unlike the ""morality"" of the Jew who converted to Islam and married Muhammad yesterday and sold her body and soul to Islam. The following is a true and powerful story that shows the power and strength of a pure Jewish woman who chose to die for the sanctification of God rather than convert to her religion and convert to Islam. ("""" Allah Solika """") It is said that the Hagaval family in the city of Tanzir, Morocco, gave birth to an amazingly beautiful baby. Her parents are kosher and devout Jews, raised her with endless devotion and educated her on the knees of faith and the ways of God. When she grew up and became a particularly beautiful girl, her parents made sure that she would not be harmed. Her father used to tell her that the more she avoided leaving the house, the better for all of us. And the girl Solika who was educated in honor of a father and mother accepted her father's words with love and refrained from going out into the street. In addition to her wondrous wisdom and piety, the girl Solika became famous among the Jews of the community for her virtues and kindness that overshadowed their rare beauty. The hearing of the beautiful Jewish girl reached the ears of one of the wealthy Muslim sons and finally said in his mind that only this girl would marry a woman no matter what! One obstacle was in his way, the girl's religion. One day the wealthy Muslim gentleman came to Solika's parents' house and demanded that they marry their daughter to his son, but first she had to convert to Islam. Anger and fear attacked the girl's parents, and with all their heart they decided to hide their daughter in a friend's house until the rage passed. Knowing the rich gentleman, they knew that nothing would stop him from carrying out his plot. Indeed, it was not long before the soldiers of the governor arrived at the holiday of Eval with a warrant of imprisonment against their house Solika. After turning the house over in search of the girl, the soldiers took the mother hostage until she found the daughter. When the bitter news of her mother's arrest reached her ears, she decided without delay to turn herself in to the cruel governor and bring about her mother's release from the clutches of the oppressors. The girl Solika was brought before Muslim judges on an accusation that she accepted the religion of Islam and after converting to Islam she repented and returned to the bosom of her Judaism. This act, which was a plot inflicted on him by the rich son and his family, is considered a grave sin in the religion of Islam and one punishment, execution! The Muslim judges presented her with one choice, to return to the religion of Islam and not, an execution. With supreme courage the girl stood before the hostile judges and said proudly: """" I have never converted to Islam, I was a Jew and I will remain a Jew forever. I will not transgress my religion, I will accept the sentence and I will die for the sanctification of Gd! The judges, who did not expect such an aggressive response, postponed the trial to another date. Continuing to insist on her opinion, the judges sentenced Dina to be killed by the sword. She transferred to the city of Fez the seat of the king to carry out the sentence. One of the king's sons who saw the girl and was also amazed by her beauty, promised her that if she converted to Islam and married him, she would become the Queen of Morocco. Neither the money and the gold nor the honor and the government will be equal in value to the belief in the God of Israel, the God of truth and justice, she answered him decisively. When the king's son realized that the girl insisted on not converting to her religion, he threatened her that because of her stubbornness he would be swallowed up by all the Jews of Morocco. His efforts for persuasion knew no bounds, and he finally decided to bring the mayor to speak to her heart. """" Do you know that the fate of many Jews hangs on your shoulders, and you have the power to save them """"? Asked. ""Yes,"" Solika replied humbly, but I will not sin against Gd and I will not go over religious even at the cost of my life and the lives of many of my people. The rabbi's heart was filled with pride and his eyes watered with tears at the girl's steadfast standing. The rabbi got up, greeted the girl and set off. Until the last moment before the sentencing, the king's son tried to speak to her heart but in vain. Solika closed her ears and accepted her sentence. With equanimity and complete serenity, Solika gave her life for the sanctification of the name of heaven. St. Solika was laid to rest and buried in the city of Fez near the tomb of two worldly sages - Rabbi Yehuda ben Atar and Rabbi Avner of France. The girl Solika became a sacred and exemplary symbol for the Jews of Morocco and has since been referred to by all as ""Allah Solika"". """,1

"Honorable President. The right of every person to his dignity. In the case of intermarriage it is not racism. Our parents came to Israel with the thought that language is not a problem of assimilation and I understand the pain of the subject because the mountains of Israel are interdependent. On the other hand, it is clear that there is no room for incitement but information.",1

"Direct power to our President. It is good that the voice of sanity is heard from the mouth of one violating citizen and it is a pity that other leaders who see themselves as students of Ze'ev Jabotinsky do not follow him. Here are things I wrote in response when the affair was first published in ""Allah"": In the book of Genesis and also in the Qur'an it is written how the brothers Isaac and Ishmael reconciled between them when they brought their father Abraham for burial. And for those who do not believe in scripture, here is a historical fact: During the Crusades, the Jews of Jerusalem fought alongside their Muslim neighbors against the foreign invader. The father of the president, Professor Yosef Yoel Rivlin, recognized the brotherhood between the two peoples, precisely because he was a revisionist and a follower of Ze'ev Jabotinsky. So in principle Hassan Muhammad is right, it is just a pity that on the Arab side there are so few who think like him. Both sides must stop the vicious circle of mutual hatred, but while here the majority condemns the extremists and chanting """" Death to the Arabs """" is a criminal offense, on the Arab side the venomous sermons of the Imams calling for the slaughter of Jews fall on attentive ears without anyone daring to protest the shift """,1

Thank you, Mr. President. We in the Land of Israel no longer need Judaism. Do not need the religions do not need the Torah do not need the conservatives do not need the Sabbath do not need the ultra-Orthodox in short do not need with one but here need one society the land of the Jews does not interest anyone. Mr. President, perhaps at this time you have reached the kingdom if you are deaf to profit and rescue will come to the Jews from elsewhere. Is that all the dream he has? The dream of every Jew is to be a good player in this world, to build the people of Israel and the Torah of Israel and the Land of Israel. And in the building of the Temple we were like dreamers, we won the Land of Israel for the people of Israel who return to their land, but you want to erase the Torah of Israel in every way. What dream? Is this a Jew's dream? It was also the dream of the Greeks, they say all the arts came from the Greeks who no longer exist but the dream of this Jew was the dream of our ancestor Abraham who wanted to fix the world in the name of one in wisdom in believing in our patience Jewish nation . I believe that without the dream of football fields without any desecration of the Sabbath we will be privileged to fulfill the dream of every Jew that is the building of the Temple the building that will be built is the dream of every Jew also to be built soon nowadays Shabbat Shalom awaits the salvation of God. Desley Tekla I will add one more thing Mr. President. May God bless us in judgment, a good heart has created for me in the Rahanli Gd and a new true spirit within me.",1
"Mr. President, when it comes to one of the existential dangers of the Jewish people no less than Hamas in Gaza. We must come out against it! And as President of the State of Israel, I would expect you to condemn this or at least not encourage it. After all, there was a discussion in the Knesset committee on the issue of assimilation into marriage to Muslims and how all these cases ended in the abuse of women and their children. I have no doubt that this will also be the end of this case.",1
"In the name of ""democracy"" you and the Shmuelans are destroying our country giving legitimacy to assimilate, freedom of expression for Arabs in the Knesset to say that our army commits war crimes, supporting terrorists, the police arresting a woman waving the Israeli flag in Rabin Square in front of a leftist demonstration supporting terrorism.

"The president of the Jewish state should express a solid opinion that forbids intermarriage with all due respect to democracy. One of the reasons that the Jewish people returned to their country because of the same assimilation that threatened to exterminate it in the Diaspora. There is no difference between physical murder and spiritual murder. That a president would not condemn such a spiritual assassination. Unlike if the situation were the other way around, there was a physical assassination of that Arab who dared to marry a Jew. Luckily there are no Jews who want or think to assimilate among the Gentiles and especially the Arabs. Generations of Jews were slaughtered And you are the elected president of the Jewish state calling for tolerance and restraint. This is simply a shame for the Jewish people.",1

Shame on you for contradicting your values. You yourself say that contacts for the age of 18 and above everyone decides for himself and if so he decided to marry an Arab nothing happened. Even a Jewish couple who marries and does not get along are divorcing each other to all those who say tomorrow she will come back beaten and divorced. I want to tell you that the percentage of divorced Jews is among the Jews. Let them start their way and wish them good luck.,1

This is a president who will be healthy. Our Prime Minister and the great Mary Regev have risen and succeeded.,0
She was an excellent moth who got a slightly more significant role and started dealing with licks and trying to get more points with the media.,1
"It is interesting that every time something right-wing is said, they immediately shout incitement ... but the leftists demonstrate week after week against the state against the soldiers (and even really inciting statements) and in favor of folding and giving benefits to a terrorist organization and not once saying incitement. You get a sense of humor from Shabbat after Shabbat after Shabbat, and moreover, but every Friday you report in advance about the demonstration that is going to take place and give them a promo, on Shabbat before Shabbat they send a team there. Carefully photograph each sign and each their reading. Fucking interviews one of them and lets him talk !!! Have you ever heard that we interviewed someone from a right-wing demonstration and let him speak ?? !!!!! I was in a demonstration in front of the campus on July 29, which had barely five people, but the police threw everyone into a shrunken corner away from the reporters and when I shouted for production why not put someone on the show who would show public opinion that public right to know and freedom of speech and mouth shut up Extremely sloppy and said I would say death broadcast to Arabs or something. I, who educated myself and my whole family to the heritage of Mapai and work. That my father was a member of the Labor Party and at a fairly high number on the list at the time and all my life, through my iniquities and by default, I voted for Labor. Present any tweet that is not left-wing as far-right and thus actually create a self-fulfilling prophecy that non-extremists avoid attending demonstrations and so their voice is not heard at all. Let's put the cards on the table today The overwhelming majority of the public in the country is a moderate right. But the media defeats the public by demonizing right-wing views from the root. Oh, and I also forgot to mention that in every demonstration of the left, which is sublimely surveyed as mentioned, even bother to mention at any moment the handful of the right that may be expected to arrive or have arrived and whether or not it is making riots. In advance they code that he will ""make riots,"" and it is interesting that for the tango the ""riots"" ""this also never needs two.""",1

It is true that in a boxed article we enter into the concept of ""civil marriages"". , But I pray that we in the Jewish people will know how to preserve our identity and certainly that these are new families that are being established """" in the people sitting in Zion """" And again I emphasize that we are all committed to keeping the law.

May the abundance and happiness of an Arab son of Nazareth and my son be satisfied with him because the flags of the flag of purity and honesty will purify two banks of the Jordan. The missiles and rockets are deliberately sent to kill us. And the same goes for the hoisting of PLO flags, Hamas jihad, ISIS, etc. There is a huge difference between the hallucinators and spray-painters with a badge and those from the educated Arab public here who identify with our enemies. Support for Hamas and its pilgrimage to Bishara in Qatar. Here I ask to hear a clear and unequivocal voice from him, so far. The burden of proof is on the Arabs here who are part of a huge majority in the Middle East, a majority that threatens anyone who is not a parent",1

I am among those hoping for your choice because you are just right. May you win an artist!,0
"There is no doubt that a true Democrat, one of the Likud members I value the most, and not because of the political opinions, because it is likely that there are many constituencies, maintaining our state as a Jewish and democratic state is a necessary condition for our existence here, there is no debate about that.",0

There is no consolation,0
Congratulations and good luck in the high role.,0
"Dear President, you have completely lost it. It is not wise to always use the same words and say no to racism nor incitement nor violence. The democratic right of right-wing activists to demonstrate outside the courtroom is the same as the right of Morel and Mahmoud to get married. It is enough to beautify and say all the enlightened and cool words that will sound good. Just because you are a president does not mean that you should support the marriage of a Jew and a Muslim. Both Muslims and Jews are against this marriage and not because of racism but because it goes against the religion and belief of each of the religions. Get out of the movie you have to be stately sometimes a president has to take a stand and not always be the one who says what is ""right"" to say. This post reminds me a bit of the ""world peace"" phenomenon in the Miss Universe pageant. No one incites, and it is the right of every person in a democracy to demonstrate even if it does not go down well with the people. """,0
"Well done to the President, there is no room for racism in this country. Otherwise we are like 22 Arab countries. We are a democracy and its right to marry whoever comes to it",0
Amen yes there will be a will.,0
"I wish it was as simple as it sounds to you. A small example If the Lahav organization did not exist, there would be much less hatred for Arabs / Sudanese or anyone who is not a Jew. We are with a pit that educates us to repeat our past without even noticing or blinking. The main thing is that we pass constructive criticism of other countries.",0

I had the greatest love I will go Mr. Revlin and now I just do not understand you ... You give legitimacy to assimilation at this time I understand why Netanyahu's views were in the presidential election against you if such opinions like yours cause failure I am sorry to hear these statements have no connection between our lives together And the Democrats in this country and what Zabotinsky wrote with a free people in our country but Zabotinsky did not write with a free people in our assimilation! There is a saying that life and death in the hands of the tongue should be awake and careful not to be dragged because whoever is dragged behind remains not so happy and these facts I will not link,1
"- - - Congratulations to the President on his position - - But ???? In practice, members of his Likud faction and the national camp and government do not allow freedom of choice in marriage. The right to family life is enshrined in international law and also in the Basic Law of Human Dignity and Liberty and is considered a supreme value. But in practice the Interior Ministry whose top officials have been appointed",0
Exemplary. This voice is so important and so lacking. You prove it is possible to be national and enlightened. The belligerent and horrific reactions show how important it is for the leadership that considers itself national to take responsibility and set the boundaries.,0

"Honorable President, I am glad that you are the President of the State of Israel, and I wish you the best of blessings and best wishes. Yesterday you raised a status that caused me sorrow and heartache that the President of the Jewish State gives his blessing to the assimilation of a holy daughter of Israel here in the Holy Land. The honor of our sacred teachings precedes all democracy, because it is the one who has preserved us as the eternal people that sets us apart from all other peoples. Unfortunately, this is a phenomenon found among our Jewish brethren who tied their lives in the Diaspora. What will his nephews say in the Diaspora? I am so sorry, Mr. President, that I have found it appropriate and necessary to write to you. Hello and congratulations, Your Honor",1
"If you speak like this, it is a great pity that you were elected, you despise the Jewish soul within you. I thought of you differently. From today you are not my president. I deleted you. Even Peres would not dare to speak like that. Your statements are worse than the deed of Moshe Katsav. You shame the President's house",1

The restrained pain is enough .. the time has come for Israeli domination to take control of the entire area between the Jordan and the sea ..... enough for us .... and enough,1

"And what about the terrorists who live among us on the standard of ""Israeli Arabs"" who walk around with blue IDs (and I'm not talking about citizens like Mahran Rady) and are included in all the benefits included in it. Who celebrate every soldier we kill, who go out to demonstrations against our army and state, who celebrate every rumor about the abduction of our soldier, who go out and kill our civilian in the middle of Jerusalem and injure a soldier, ours again !!! So what, we'll continue to support them in working for contractors and wait until next time to rehabilitate another terrorist who is working on a tractor and decides to go out and try to murder as many civilians as possible? Will we continue to pay them the Social Security we pay? Will we continue to take care of them and take care of all their infrastructure while they are just trying to murder us ??? Isn't it time to change this crazy behavior? The next operation should be against them. They are protesting against the army, happy about dead soldiers so it is time to move them to live in Gaza because they are no less dangerous than the terrorists in the Strip itself.",1

I wish you that God would restore your understanding to you, that she would probably run away from you at your extreme age. I'm ashamed of you !!!!",1

"Hello, in the US and in Europe, everyone is getting married to everyone and it is already happening, in my opinion in this country it will happen in the future for two main reasons: 1) The rabbinate makes it difficult for people to convert and this is a very significant obstacle. 2) A respectable portion of the immigrants to Israel one of their parents is Jewish and even the grandfather or grandfather of a Jewish father and they are divided between Christianity and Judaism or simply an excuse and not related to Judaism to a better standard of living. Than the countries that came from it, makes sense?",1
I really liked your speech in the Knesset. Usually I have patience to hear speeches but this time I really enjoyed listening to the speech.,0
"It is your right to think what is right for you. But you need to know to get criticism you can agree and you can also not. Morale's parents are divided and her mother agrees her father turned to for help in trying to get his daughter out of the same Arab guy. Her dad cried for help so what kind of perfection are you talking about exactly? A guy comes to you and asks for help. Will you turn your back on him? That says about you ?? And if there are girls who sit with Bedouins and you sit on the side and do nothing probably yours does not have the Jewish feeling that pinches our hearts to see it. I do not want to ""sit on you"" ""because overall I have nothing against you. But I intentionally mentioned your sister (without knowing if you have or not) because as soon as it comes to a close family opinions change and I wanted to emphasize that and according to your reactions I also succeeded.""",1

"Yours sincerely Mr. Rivlin, I address you on behalf of retirees who have recently suffered from the new provision requiring them to present a senior citizen certificate to the driver, if the certificate is not in their possession the full price of the ticket is imposed on them. From France a copy of letters sent to Egged's public inquiries and it should be noted that they answered immediately and referred me to the Minister of Transport, from my experience I know that there is no point in contacting the Minister I address you as our beloved President in the hope that you can find an answer. In Haifa, at one of the stations, a very elderly woman, wrinkled and asked to pay for the trip, the driver approached her and asked her to present him with a senior citizen card, since the bus was traveling, and in order to get the ticket she had to hold the bag with both hands and look for the certificate. Is to fall if the driver stops abruptly, I turned to the driver and asked why he does not believe the woman? She told him that at the age of 85, the driver explained that this was a directive of the Ministry of Transportation and that he must obey or be fined NIS 5,000 because he had been criticized. I checked with Mr. Ziad from the Haifa Association and he verified this instruction. I asked, is there no room for driver discretion? After all, Egged drivers are intelligent enough to distinguish between an impostor and an old man, there is a thing called ""before the law"" ""I appeal to refresh the instruction that causes sadness to both adults and drivers. Hopefully common sense will work in this case, with great respect, Rachel Azaria , Chairman of the Pensioners' Committee, Board Member, and Mount Carmel Committee",2

Instead of making sure that the rabbinate allows without making it difficult for those who want to convert and become Jewish, you should not go through a thousand generations of hell, if at all ... therefore the easy way to leave Judaism .. it is a shame for the state .... expect from the state that whoever qualifies and serves the state and wants to be a Jew, because he immigrated as a Jew and that is what he knows ... to soften the rabbinate and allow people freedom to fulfill their dream and not leave religion ... think about it. Maybe take care of the rabbinate there ...",1

"As a native of Moshav, he identifies with every word and letter of Nehama's words. However, there is among us that the whole essence of the holiday is a meaningless de facto de facto: those who have never plowed a single furrow, have not planted, have not planted, have not plowed or raised farm animals and are not going to serve in the army. They will determine for the farmer when the cows will eat kosher food for Passover, and what will be open or not on Shabbat and what will not ... and who is the convert. Everyone knows which one. Therefore, their connection to true Judaism is indeed questionable.",1

"It is very nice to defend freedom of expression, to come out against incitement, violence and racism, and of course to increase the democratic rule, but what about the principles, Mr. President ?? Does he not have an opinion on assimilation? If his honor (or writers) have already formulated a few lines on Facebook, what about the entries? The principles? We grieve the assimilation of most of our people's building abroad, but when it's in this country it's already the freedom of democracy - the individual - and worship? Another disappointment. Beauty then His Majesty won the likes.",1
Well done to the President and his state and democratic conduct. This is exactly what a president should do - remind us of what values ??the Zionist state was built on,0

Such a president I Ruth for us such that despite his right-wing views he believes in love. No one should interfere in the matter of love. Love is a miracle created between human beings and anyone who harms such a miracle deserves to be despised. All hysterics who try to hurt should try to think why they do it ......,0

Ruby in the giant plate!,0
"And something else tiny and no one will tell me demagoguery. Mr. President, if your granddaughter *** God forbid and God bless you were in such a situation and would like to marry an Arab, would you express yourself like that even then? We all know the truth so why when it comes to other people do you try to show ""enlightened and liberal"" ""about the blood of a helpless Jewish family?""",1

"I also propose in honor of the President to work for the establishment of civil marriage in the State of Israel. Even when there is such a possibility, the vast majority in the country will choose to marry in an Orthodox Jewish marriage. It therefore makes sense to allow a minority that is not interested in it to choose otherwise.",0
"Dear President of the State. It is very nice and warm that you have chosen to share in the grief of Daniel's family. At the funeral, he was quoted as saying: ""You do not have to stay here"" (or something like that) so here is an offer from the President (although it is clear that it will not be accepted).

"We must return Israeli heritage studies to the education system. It is not possible that some delusional journalists will try to shape public opinion. It is not possible that when Dan Shilon asks such a stupid question about intermarriage, not a single person will stand up and explain or ask the question: Is it a shame to be a Jew? Is it a shame to want to preserve my identity? A mixed marriage of a girl who converts to Islam is acceptable to the left, while one who strives to preserve and preserve his Jewish identity is considered dark. Mr. President: I ask you for an answer to a simple question: If you are in favor of intermarriage, then you are giving a hand to the conversion of the Jewish people, so why not give the keys to the Muslim people in Israel today and return to Europe, to the Holocaust?",1
Most of the State of Israel exists thanks to religion and life thanks to religion what reads with them can not be mixed marriages im they want to go to Jordan to Syria to Turkey and have a good but not in Israel a state that exists on religion and this is the most important thing in the country and we live on religion and according to Torah this marriage is forbidden success In a foreign country not in Israel,1
"Mr. President, I can not respect the assimilation of my people, the daughters of Israel to the people of Israel, if there was an Arab who marries a Jew they would cross, burn and stone them, enough to use the bullshit of the word democracy, the democracy we are so proud of shattered our country and our people to pieces , There is no tolerance and forbearance for assimilation, extreme left and traitors and you will have success in the job.",1

The public protests against marriage right we live in a democracy but I want to ask the honorable president Will his family allow his sister to marry a Jewish man? No, she will kill on the grounds of family honor ... and most girls who marry minorities suffer and a Yad Laachim organization saves them from the atrocities they go through in Morel's case. They try to save her another Jewish soul ... But the easiest and most requested is to accuse the right as usual and interesting that the left is enlightened then His Majesty that all the enlightened will give their daughters to minorities for the wedding we will see them",1

"I wonder what the late Menachem Begin would have thought of your words. I guess he would have been ashamed. And here are his words: intermarriage and the danger of assimilation ""True, there has been a ban on marriage between Jews and non-Jews since ancient times. Is this racism? If so, perhaps our Hebrew language, to which we have adhered, is also racist? What have we dealt with in this language? It has been forgotten for generations. No, we said, we will speak Hebrew. How we clung to this land, how we prayed for rains in it, thousands of miles away from it. When no benefit has come to us from this prayer? Or is it racism? True, the Jewish people have unity and uniqueness in it, otherwise it would not exist. On the contrary, every progressive will take the stage and tell us - I have another suggestion: he will close the room and say to himself - would the people have existed, had it not been for this prohibition? Had he not disappeared along with mighty peoples from him and would no male have remained, or would he have remained but a male, from him. The little against the many - had to be kept. Had intermarriage been permitted, not even a remnant and a refugee would have remained of us. Our people could number between 200 and 250 million people, because it is one of the oldest peoples on earth whose thread of existence has not been severed even one day for thousands of years. Why are there only three to ten million left? Two reasons for this: the massacre and the assimilation. And who knows if the assimilation did not take what the massacre took. Certainly many millions in all generations. Were it not for this prohibition, we would have long since been assimilated. There are those who claim: in fact, why should this people exist? He suffers, others suffer. We, the Jews and the Zionists, did not accept the Torah of disappearance. We seek no justification for our existence. We do not seek any recognition of our right to exist, neither from a king, nor from a general, nor from a ruler, nor from a government, nor from any other nation or language. We exist. Our right to exist, and we will continue to exist. We do not want to get off the stage of history. We do not want to assimilate. We have something to contribute to ourselves and to all of humanity. This is the essence of Judaism and the national liberation movement called Zionism. There is a prohibition on marriage as it is written: """" And you shall not marry them. Thou shalt not give thy son to his son, nor his daughter shalt thou take unto thy son, for he will take away thy son from after me, and they shall serve other gods. And our sages interpreted the verse as the words of Rash """" 10, """" We have learned that the son of your next daughter from the Hittite is called your son, but the son of your son who comes from the Hittite, is not called your son but her son, for it is not said of his daughter: Your son """". Thus arose the halachah according to which the son of a Jewish mother is a Jew, even his father is not a Jew, not the other way around. Will this be called racism? - The unclean racism for which one drop of Jewish blood was enough to lead the man in which it flows to a place from which there is no return, while Jewish law says: If the mother is Jewish, there is not even assurance that the father is Jewish, there is even assurance that the father is not Jewish. Were it not for this prohibition and if it were not for this law, who would face the disappearance and problem of existence throughout the Diaspora? What do certain people want, that the Jewish state that has risen to the Jewish people in sacrifices and torments and human and non-human efforts, from the Jewish state will come the news that intermarriage has no prohibition and no obstacle? Most of them will be assimilated like everyone else. For several generations this nation may disappear. Go to Scandinavia and see what is left of the Jewish settlements there as a result of intermarriage. Soon there will be nothing left but a memory of them in a synagogue that still exists on its own. .... """" And as for the Jew - and this I knew - there is no separation between nationality and religion, then in terms of religion and nationality alike the answer as to who is a Jew is determined and will be determined by halakhah, there are people who when they hear the word ""halakhah"" come out of their mouths or From the mouths of others, they demand that all hearers fall down to the ground, stand up and be beaten for sin. This is a reaction - they say - these are light rebels, bearers of darkness, will not come in the advanced crowd, certainly not in the next world, not even in this world. I'm sorry, I'm not shivering and I'm not shocked. What because you have dealt with this law, what because we have hung on it, what because you will despise and what because you will humiliate? This halakhah by which eternal life was planted within us, this halakhah that sustained us in tests of blood and fire and divorces and wanderings. There are those who swear and do not hesitate to say that Jewish law is racist, and that it is reminiscent of Nazism. Woe to the ears that hear this. In the days when all our enemies in the soul call for the liberation of our country """" Nazi occupation """": In the days when those who signed the agreement with Nazism and opened the trenches of evil before World War II, call us unclean, our people come to our country and cast such blemishes on our people for generations. What do these people want, that our children should be ashamed of being born Jews? What do they want, that it is said that we must flee from the heritage of our ancestors to be decent people and not Nazis and not racists? Jewish law, which has existed for thousands of years, is racist, and a self-respecting person will run away from it. Did we come here to be ashamed of our Judaism, of our forefathers, or to continue their legacy? How can a person in Israel not compare the ""Jew"" ""listed on the ID card and the"" Larry ""register among the unclean among them? Is Jewish law racist? Since the plot of a blood libel against this people, it has not been more terrible than the one that originated in a self-plot. Racism hates foreignness and migration, and Jewish law? The term """" lived """" has two meanings, and so they have evolved over the generations. What does the law say? """" Makes an orphan and widow sentence and loves to give him bread and a dress. And you loved Hagar, because you lived in the land of Egypt. And you will not live and we will not press, because you lived in the land of Egypt. "" With almost every verse like this, the command and the commandment are repeated, because you lived in the land of Egypt. Where will you find a higher anti-racist morality than this? """". """,1
"The president of the Jewish state should express a solid opinion that forbids intermarriage with all due respect to democracy. One of the reasons that the Jewish people returned to their country because of the same assimilation that threatened to exterminate it in the Diaspora. There is no difference between physical murder and spiritual murder. That a president would not condemn such a spiritual assassination. Unlike if the situation were the other way around, there was a physical assassination of that Arab who dared to marry a Jew. Luckily there are no Jews who want or think to assimilate among the Gentiles and especially the Arabs. Generations of Jews were slaughtered And you are the elected president of the Jewish state calling for tolerance and restraint. This is simply a shame for the Jewish people.",1

"Unlike the ""morality"" of the Jew who converted to Islam and married Muhammad yesterday and sold her body and soul to Islam. The following is a true and powerful story that shows the power and strength of a pure Jewish woman who chose to die for the sanctification of God rather than convert to her religion and convert to Islam. ("""" Allah Solika """") It is said that the Hagaval family in the city of Tanzir, Morocco, gave birth to an amazingly beautiful baby. Her parents are kosher and devout Jews, raised her with endless devotion and educated her on the knees of faith and the ways of God. When she grew up and became a particularly beautiful girl, her parents made sure that she would not be harmed. Her father used to tell her that the more she avoided leaving the house, the better for all of us. And the girl Solika who was educated in honor of a father and mother accepted her father's words with love and refrained from going out into the street. In addition to her wondrous wisdom and piety, the girl Solika became famous among the Jews of the community for her virtues and kindness that overshadowed their rare beauty. The hearing of the beautiful Jewish girl reached the ears of one of the wealthy Muslim sons and finally said in his mind that only this girl would marry a woman no matter what! One obstacle was in his way, the girl's religion. One day the wealthy Muslim gentleman came to Solika's parents' house and demanded that they marry their daughter to his son, but first she had to convert to Islam. Anger and fear attacked the girl's parents, and with all their heart they decided to hide their daughter in a friend's house until the rage passed. Knowing the rich gentleman, they knew that nothing would stop him from carrying out his plot. Indeed, it was not long before the soldiers of the governor arrived at the holiday of Eval with a warrant of imprisonment against their house Solika. After turning the house over in search of the girl, the soldiers took the mother hostage until she found the daughter. When the bitter news of her mother's arrest reached her ears, she decided without delay to turn herself in to the cruel governor and bring about her mother's release from the clutches of the oppressors. The girl Solika was brought before Muslim judges on an accusation that she accepted the religion of Islam and after converting to Islam she repented and returned to the bosom of her Judaism. This act, which was a plot inflicted on him by the rich son and his family, is considered a grave sin in the religion of Islam and one punishment, execution! The Muslim judges presented her with one choice, to return to the religion of Islam and not, an execution. With supreme courage the girl stood before the hostile judges and said proudly: """" I have never converted to Islam, I was a Jew and I will remain a Jew forever. I will not transgress my religion, I will accept the sentence and I will die for the sanctification of Gd! The judges, who did not expect such an aggressive response, postponed the trial to another date. Continuing to insist on her opinion, the judges sentenced Dina to be killed by the sword. She transferred to the city of Fez the seat of the king to carry out the sentence. One of the king's sons who saw the girl and was also amazed by her beauty, promised her that if she converted to Islam and married him, she would become the Queen of Morocco. Neither the money and the gold nor the honor and the government will be equal in value to the belief in the God of Israel, the God of truth and justice, she answered him decisively. When the king's son realized that the girl insisted on not converting to her religion, he threatened her that because of her stubbornness he would be swallowed up by all the Jews of Morocco. His efforts for persuasion knew no bounds, and he finally decided to bring the mayor to speak to her heart. """" Do you know that the fate of many Jews hangs on your shoulders, and you have the power to save them """"? Asked. ""Yes,"" Solika replied humbly, but I will not sin against Gd and I will not go over religious even at the cost of my life and the lives of many of my people. The rabbi's heart was filled with pride and his eyes watered with tears at the girl's steadfast standing. The rabbi got up, greeted the girl and set off. Until the last moment before the sentencing, the king's son tried to speak to her heart but in vain. Solika closed her ears and accepted her sentence. With equanimity and complete serenity, Solika gave her life for the sanctification of the name of heaven. St. Solika was laid to rest and buried in the city of Fez near the tomb of two worldly sages - Rabbi Yehuda ben Atar and Rabbi Avner of France. The girl Solika became a sacred and exemplary symbol for the Jews of Morocco and has since been referred to by all as ""Allah Solika"". """,1

In this instruction stepping on others, there is here only an instruction for this group that will continue to maintain itself so that this group will not be lost from the world. Because the global purpose for which the people of Israel exist is an eternal goal, it must be ensured that this people will continue to exist forever and ever, and the first element to ensure this is to preserve identity through the prevention of assimilation.",1

"What we are undecided to say, the Torah writes in 3 words - ""and it will not succeed"". There are powerful trends and muscles predestined to failure. They belong to the family of illegal immigrants on the mountain. Is it really possible to establish a Jewish reality, a state with present and future, This question is addressed to us, the people who believe in God and Moses worked and secretly hope that the political echelons will begin to make 'brave decisions', crush Hamas and stop making us internationally ashamed. Here is a tested virtue for returning to sanity: Draw for yourself from time to time, at That you are returning from the synagogue on Saturday night, preparing in awe for Kiddush and the meal, and when the little boy sends an accidental finger to the power switch, 'Shabbat!' Jumps in panic, well at that time the people who will restore our security and make strategic decisions for Zion's redemption. Meat with yellow cheese and accumulating prohibitions on routine excision. Right education? Yes, of course. They are all captive babies and therefore our attitude towards them should be like preterm infants in the incubator: lots of compassion, lots of prayers. And drums no !! Does the role of the Jewish Agency not include, among other things, preventing assimilation in the Diaspora? So what will they say now if here in the Land of Israel they dare to have a wedding whose whole essence is assimilation, and more in public? Until you come to preach to us about assimilation you will see what is happening in your country, will be the answer. After all, an Arab is not allowed to marry a Jew and that means she has converted to Islam or should convert to Islam. If it was your daughter you would talk like that. Shame disgraced to a person who sees himself as traditional. You are probably really dedicated - T. Saws from Judaism everything that is difficult for you to accept or maintain. """,1

"How sad, tragic and tearful",0
The only red line I now know is your crossing in a red line and it is clear that a Jew is marrying a Jew and there is no Jew in the world who will atone for our Jewish daughters all the Gentiles. Maybe you Rivlin it does not bother because that Jew of yesterday is not your home so it is far from you. I cried like my sister was and my heart aches for her father's pain drinking blood from sadness. And you come out of nowhere and dare to wish good luck and dare to say that it is incitement on our part that we tried to save her. You are rude and your late father wanted you to be president but not for this result your father hoped not A son who flatters the Arabs in exchange for a chair that pads the ass and a salary of cream ... just shame and disgrace.,1
There's something about this man that radiates integrity ... I wish we could say that about a few more in the repulsive political swamp ...,0

Wow. What modesty !!,0
"Mr. Rivlin (and not the Honorable President, unfortunately), Golda overturns in the grave, Ben-Gurion as above, who guessed and who thought we would reach such a disgrace! A Jewish and Israeli president encourages assimilation, and to mention that we are in a war in which ""the best Westerners of Israel"" participated And other officials in all levels, made likes for the murder of IDF soldiers, wished the IDF soldiers all sorts of ugly things and rejoiced in their death, this when our cousins, residents of Israel, attack, humiliate and physically and morally harm the country's citizens in unpublished kidnapping attempts In the media, you are Mr. Rivlin in contempt for the State of Israel, if we came to this in 60 years of the State of Israel that the president encourages assimilation and the prime minister's son goes out with Norwegian, what we come to give the world in general, I fear the light we want to be Gentiles, you dignitaries To darkness and destruction! """,1
Honorable President Robbie Rivlin as a former Likudnik and as a religious person it is hard for me to hear from you giving legitimacy to such a thing it must not happen because it is their power over us they humiliate them because they are Jewish and turn them into slaves and beat them mercilessly no and no,1
Successfully ! Hope you do not disappoint,0
"Do your job, complete idiot !!! Because we are not interested in your personal opinion (do not worry we know you stink you do not have to announce it)",1
Sagi .. I wish we could live again according to the laws of religion! Because if we are called with virtue and light to the Gentiles it is only thanks to the laws of religion !!,1

"Girlfriend, are you crazy? , Every time a Jew marries a Christian / Muslim / Buddhist, etc. will they hold a demonstration against them? , It seems to me that you have lost proportion in general, we lack trouble in our ""holy"" country? ""Live and let live!""",0
"I am Jewish and there is nothing to do, I also do not want to change your opinion, with you comparing Jewish law to Iran so you are not worth a response, wait you are a Jew ???",1
"Mr. President, this is how they talk",1
"Mr. President, you are the only one of all the candidates who definitely deserves to be the next president of the Greater State of Israel successfully",0
It hurts a lot to hear and see a flower child being picked mercilessly from his family and the name will avenge his blood,0
Amen yes there will be a will.,0
"One president was massacred, another president was raped and another president was an Arab, and what country do they say that?",1

"You have forgotten from above your place a very important detail the mutual guarantee that every Jew owes to another is a moral duty embedded and ingrained in us with Israel that surpasses all the hollow slogans you have started since you took office to quote with the exaltation of democracy in your throat about freedom of expression and incitement. Indeed I see that you take a stand when it comes to justifying your words as the worst of our enemies from the extreme left do and you use the same linguistic techniques of the enlightened beauties of darkness that oppress the Israelites who cut the branch on which they sit while fed by the worst enemies and enemies of the free world. Among the people for greed money (their name will be erased) note in all the comments in this post who are the most praiseworthy your words will enter the wall of one of them sample and you will slowly understand that you are marked as someone who can spread the Islamization propaganda of the region and the world later. It all starts small until the devil takes over and spreads in your personal consciousness and is spread through your role and status to your entire sphere of influence .. Robbie Rivlin Through you I learned an important lesson that in every declared right-wing extremist leftist hides God will save you and your shoulders. I express my deep sorrow at the fact that I supported in every way that was called in my way even symbolic in your election as president and express that your soul from the way you as an undercover left made your way to the top through the hearts of the people of Israel and the whole Israel will be will and if you are as described in my response. And he will bring you back in complete repentance before him and give you in your heart the understanding to understand and enlighten your deeds and severity in the eyes of God and man. I write my words in pain and anxiety about the fate of the people sitting in Zion, because if a flame fell on the cedars, what will the mosses of the wall (the most famous wall of all) say?",1
As much as the choice was right for us to have such a president. Humble Ruby you are great. Be blessed and successful in your ministry.,0
I would settle for that Robbie!,0
Happy holiday to a dear person.,0
"Michal The only problem with marrying someone from another religion is according to what religion and values ??the children raise, I am married to my heart's choice and I would not replace her in all the women in the world, I will raise my children on the same values ??my parents made me acquire, inevitable long term assimilation in my opinion on both sides. This fact must be acknowledged.",1
"Put the keys in and you will probably retire wrong in the country you live in, and maybe in the century you live, in any case live in La La Land. We Jews live in the State of Israel, are commanded according to our teachings to be married only to Jews and there is no racism in this. You are welcome to convert to Islam if you did not like the laws of the Torah ... just do not forget to lock and leave the keys.",1
For years I have been waiting for you to elect a president so I was happy that you were finally elected and now I am very sorry! A Jewish president who encourages assimilation!,1

It is a great honor for us that the honor of the president is human and death and joy are at the forefront of his eyes and his participation in them is out of a desire and duty to represent the leaders of our people. There is no willingness and desire to be present where they are expected and it is a pity ...,0

"There is hunger in Israel. There is abundance in Israel. Nothing is missing. And at cheap prices. But the price that citizens get triples and quadruples themselves in networks. Brokerage gaps are growing and growing by hundreds of percent. And the lust for pigs is only rising. Once upon a time a hungry child would express himself in terrible thinness. Today hunger does not come in the form of thinness. Some children are not thin but they are hungry: they eat only what is cheap. Only the garbage that exists in the market because of the economic returns in Israel. Eat only bread in the family. Because there is no money for vegetables and fruits that are priced in pig and overpriced chains. That's why you do not see the hungry child on the street. It is the transparent Western hunger. There is an excess of healthy food like vegetables and fruits and more ... but there are those who pull the strings for pigs for greed. There is no government policy on this issue. This is the government's betrayal of the citizen. Access to food is a political question. And the government has the ability to change economic policy but it is not interested. And the government even encourages with the help of laws non-compete, centralization to the point of bullying of a limited number of people who control the food market:. The film raises the bar above the continuing denial of the hunger phenomenon in Israel, which has begun to gain momentum in the last decade, mainly due to the massive and continuing rise in prices of most basic food products, and examines the effects of the phenomenon on health. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxRJZkDMFx8 Vacuum Season 3: Western Hunger in the State of Israel More and more people are eating what they can afford and not what they need ....",2

You're just a king love you !!,0

"And I do not believe that no one remembered that a Jewish girl converted to Islam in this process of mixed marriage and that in the eyes of the President of our country is okay? The demonstration is bothered by the catastrophe here that if we do not stop it in a hundred years, what will be left of the Jewish people? And that's what you should have been talking about, Robbie, not about a silly demonstration that will do nothing, pity you, Robbie!",1
Charming and human. Consolation will be a refreshing change in the corridors of power. Goodluck tomorrow .,0
How much love there is in the soul for the State of Israel to you !!!!! Love you Honorable President .... I personally felt that in your virtues the levels of human dignity and love of country ....

I wish our next president would be the salt of the earth. No skeletons in the closet.,0

I love you Mr. President. You are a great and wise man and I as an Israeli citizen I am proud to cry. And I strengthen your hand and continue in this way because you are right in what you say,0
"You crossed a red line. Not that Maulanit, in favor of a marriage according to the religion of Moses and Israel, each with his own personal choices and considerations. This is not a political, private matter of the couple only. The president's remarks on the matter are also exaggerated. Too much fuss about nothing.",1
Of course the postma has the right to marry whoever she wants even with a goat. But suddenly the man becomes enlightened and forgets where he was educated in the most racist party Herut so that he will not come to teach us that he will first of all educate the fans of the biggest racist party,0
Incomprehensible !!!,0
Amen and amen,0
I always ask myself what you're doing there at the President's House all day and I'm talking about moving to Grandpa and all sorts of things,0
Honorable President I have not yet seen a Muslim girl go out with a Jewish guy and stay alive. And I would not wish on anyone to go out with an Arab. This is a dangerous trend that is gnawing at the world of the Jewish spirit and should not be given a hand and certainly not welcomed by the presidency.,1

I share the grief of the families the name will be the blood of the children who were murdered in cold blood. I think we need to learn a little from Putin how to deal with extremist and cowardly and cowardly Muslims who go and kidnap defenseless boys and punish them and their families mercilessly !!,1
Great pain ..: (,0

Ruby you remember we swore in the bible you will let it be written in the bible that assimilation is a pity you swear and you will not know what it is also forbidden sorry I say in your case silence is worth gold I am ashamed of you you are a president who is not proud of his Judaism and willing to sell the daughter of Israel to a lowly There is in the Bible the story of Shimon and Levi who killed an entire city for Dina that it and they deserve it easily and materially that even on the eve of this depression he deserves punishment for not converting the Jew.,1

Botinsky, who did a thing or two more than all the children of Hela Familia, said and acted in the spirit of what Ruby Rivlin said. He remained faithful to the way. You? You do not even know what it is and do not know the history ...

"Honorable President, if you can not express your opinion publicly against assimilation, for one reason or another, then I think it is better not to express your opinion at all on issues related to assimilation. Fulfilled, if you were interviewed and had no choice but to spread on your own initiative a post that has no word against assimilation, but only words for freedom, it is problematic and a pity! I'm convinced that Begin, who was a gentleman no less than you, would have behaved differently.",1
Wake up to the harsh reality in our country and in the world ... We are persecuted by the Arabs everywhere ... and they have no dreams like that of the President ...

Going to ask for a blessing from rabbis to get the president's chair is that okay? And if Rabbi Ovadia was alive what would you react to you giving a hand to assimilation,1
Apparently the president's opinions remain the same only the name of the person who says them changes. Too bad . We thought there would be a change but today we came to know that Ruby Rivlin is actually Shimon Peres. You were disappointed,1
What a disgraceful president. So strenuous,1

"Mr. President, everything is right. Just a small question at your disposal - are Jews also allowed to marry a Muslim Arab and maintain their freedom in our democratic state? This, of course, before her family members slaughter him ?? ...

In these mixed groups will be from all religions who want to volunteer, and the condition, cultural language and factual and factual debate !!

"The president of the country, who respects the tradition, is wondering about you. For generations we have known, even those who were far from any glimmer of Torah observance and mitzvos, that marriage to a foreigner is a red line. Especially marriage to a son who is an enemy of the Jewish people. With the people of Israel fighting Palestinian terror on a daily basis, it is not appropriate that the president should find it appropriate to welcome an marriage to the enemy.",1

Severely disappointed in you. I would like to see your girl or granddaughter marry an Arab and more become one. What a chair can do and that's just a chair.,1
"The state's attitude towards them belittles both the security aspect and the economic aspect. Personal Information - There are still no clear guidelines regarding the payment of a July salary even to residents of the Gaza Strip who have been instructed to leave their homes. As the president of the state, you must deal with this - take the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Economy for a conversation and urge them to issue written and clear instructions to employers on how much and how much they should pay employees.",1

"Bless you, President of the State of Israel. Great work ahead of us in dealing with racism, incitement and violence against the Arab citizens of Israel. It is not appropriate for you - by virtue of your status and by virtue of your long-standing position on this issue - to lead the campaign. Be strong and courageous",0

"It is interesting that every time something right-wing is said, they immediately shout incitement ... but the leftists demonstrate week after week against the state against the soldiers (and even really inciting statements) and in favor of folding and giving benefits to a terrorist organization and not once saying incitement. You get a sense of humor from Shabbat after Shabbat after Shabbat, and moreover, but every Friday you report in advance about the demonstration that is going to take place and give them a promo, on Shabbat before Shabbat they send a team there. Carefully photograph each sign and each their reading. Fucking interviews one of them and lets him talk !!! Have you ever heard that we interviewed someone from a right-wing demonstration and let him speak ?? !!!!! I was in a demonstration in front of the campus on July 29, which had barely five people, but the police threw everyone into a shrunken corner away from the reporters and when I shouted for production why not put someone on the show who would show public opinion that public right to know and freedom of speech and mouth shut up Extremely sloppy and said I would say death broadcast to Arabs or something. I, who educated myself and my whole family to the heritage of Mapai and work. That my father was a member of the Labor Party and at a fairly high number on the list at the time and all my life, through my iniquities and by default, I voted for Labor. Present any tweet that is not left-wing as far-right and thus actually create a self-fulfilling prophecy that non-extremists avoid attending demonstrations and so their voice is not heard at all. Let's put the cards on the table today The overwhelming majority of the public in the country is a moderate right. But the media defeats the public by demonizing right-wing views from the root. Oh, and I also forgot to mention that in every demonstration of the left, which is sublimely surveyed as mentioned, even bother to mention at any moment the handful of the right that may be expected to arrive or have arrived and whether or not it is making riots. In advance they code that he will ""make riots,"" and it is interesting that for the tango the ""riots"" ""this also never needs two.""",1
"Dear Ruby, you are about to become the president of our country who really needs a visionary president who knew that a lot of responsibility falls on his shoulders. The state needs the president as a role model in his personality, conduct and love. The young state of Israel is still learning from mistakes and as we see, thorough chimney cleaning has been taking place in recent years. All the negative - floating and rising, it is no longer possible to hide injustices and evil deeds. In the hope that the cleansing we are witnessing will be thorough and from it a healthier and fairer society will be built. I wish you with all my heart, great success and I have no doubt that you can get great advice from President Peres, that a president like him has not been here. You have all the qualities to succeed. Be strong and embrace dear man!",0
"Do not think the president should address everything that happens, even if status should be renewed.",1
"Finally ! Thank you . Perhaps after your remarks, even the Minister of Culture and Sports will not be helpful in intervening in this horrific phenomenon.",0
"Honorable President Rivlin, as President of the State of Israel, you must pay close attention to when it comes to a matter concerning the four mothers of man, which is between him and his God, and when the matter concerns the whole of Israel and how we would like Israeli society to look. The Torah has already said: ""The hidden from God our God and revealed to us and our sons forever"" "". Secretly, that man will do what he thinks and believes and the account is private between him and God,"" but in public ?! The enormous responsibility lies with you to make sure the educational message of the leadership The public turns to the right building of the nation.In the public space the questions to be asked are: Why do we want to educate our children and what is the value-worthy message to the State of Israel.How did you get it wrong ?! The assimilation of our sons and daughters is a sick evil that your fathers sat on seven? We lived throughout the exile to prevent the assimilation of Israel, the holy people, among the Gentiles in which we lived. And it was difficult! Culturally and emotionally we were surrounded by Gentiles. The tension was great, sometimes out of affection and sometimes out of hatred, were the weakest of the nation assimilated among the Gentiles. Want to convey to the youth?! What is the message to the daughters of Israel ?! In the name of freedom blurs the identity you are talking about You give legitimacy to the daughters of Israel to marry Gentiles ?! If you do not understand that you are a symbol for the nation what is the right vision and how to act and think, then you are not worthy to sit in office This is Shimon Peres , That I am far from his perceptions East and West, knew the importance of the institution of the presidency, and used its status to represent the State of Israel in the name of its values. He did not care about individual freedom as much as you care! He condemned any behavior of a ""private"" Jew who expressed or acted in public in a manner that did not conform to his worldview! And rightly so. This is the institution of the presidency. You have been elected president in the name of your worldview. The people of Israel believe that you represent better than those who oppose you the way the State of Israel should be seen at the public level. Why when a person with the most adapted values ??to Judaism arrives, folds his worldview, and hides it in the name of so-called individual freedom ?! What, then, is the point of electing a president ?! The people of Israel expect more from you, our esteemed president. """,1

"Honorable President, I wish you that your grandchildren will all marry Muslims,",1
For all the quarrelsome people who have no employment other than sitting on a keyboard and voicing their stupid opinions. Where is the problem with marrying an Arab and especially that the bride will convert to Islam. Where ??? Stop pushing your nose at what you have no control over and especially the love that blossoms between an Arab and a Jew. those who jealous shall live and suffer .,0
Good luck ??,0
"For all the slanderers, you will grow up with limited children! Not everyone must think alike and it is the right of every person to marry in love with the one whose heart tells him, what are you putting your nose in matters that are not yours !? Strengthen your words President of the State. This is the way and these are the words of truth.",0
A Jew according to Halacha must marry a Jew! Halacha is not racism!,1
You will be ashamed. You are supposed to be the president of the Jewish state and as such you are also supposed to maintain a Jewish state and tolerant statements about assimilation is not something that can be considered.,1
Good luck choosing,0
The heart is torn to pieces!,0

Ruby Question: After your selection will you continue here or is it related to the selection process?,0
With all due respect and there is no respect for why they had to emphasize the invitation of the anniversary to provoke the creators it seems that Arab would marry a Jew and would show her invitation yes who knows them at all she would stay alive Assimilation is the serious thing that God does not like and the bride will be careful Moral the blow that he will receive from God really hollow God and many more,1
Of blessed memory,0
"The heart is torn, the name will bleed.",0
"It is not incitement at all, it is already a matter of assimilation, and alas, if it continues like this and we do not stop it, it will no longer be a state of Jews.",1
Congratulations and success artist artist and artist !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,0
Blessed be the memory of all the angels God wants next to him,0
I was already laughing. There is humor to the president.,0
"Here, too, the whole Torah on one foot is, as Hillel said ... ""What is hated of you, do not do to your friend."" ""Indeed, just as it is not acceptable for us to curse and chant racist chants against a Jewish actor abroad, alas for us if We behave this way towards an Arab actor (or a cleaner or a security guard or a cook or a professor or anything else of Russian or Ethiopian or Asian descent or anything perceived as """" not ours """"). He included a rule that really fixes so many things. From basic courtesy to criminal and ethical matters. """,1
"All. The resentful can only find something to soothe and all your wishes will leave to yourself who knows what they will do and with whom your children will marry nothing uncertain,",0

"Sport is a field that really allows anyone to take part in it regardless of religion, race or gender! Those who turn sports fields into a political platform or a means of racism do not know and understand what a sport is and what its added values ??are!",0
"It's not clear to me what will close with us people you hear yourself Democracy lol What is the connection the Jewish girl how it relates to freedom of expression or democracy after all how a Jew would marry a Gentile Arab where does such a thing sound and I am not a religious person or what they call it extreme in my right ... A minimum of Judaism did not stay here, after all, this is the difference between us and their sons, it shocks me. This whole story, I feel sorry for her, that is where she came from.",1
"** Especially for you Honorable President - ** Article: ""What is really the difference between racism and assimilation"" ""? The difference between them is like the difference between heaven and earth. And if I am against the assimilation and interference of the people of Israel, does that mean I am racist and immoral ???? , I have gentile friends and I respect them, and help them, and for full equality between all, and coexistence and everything is good and excellent among us all, so I am very surprised at those wise and prudent people who say if you do not agree that your sister will marry the gentile who fell in love with him then You are a racist, what nonsense and nonsense, there are certain boundaries that I have to keep just like: in school, in the army and at home that I am not allowed to do and even if the world explodes it is against the rules and laws that accepted me into the army or school To do in the same place, what is so hard to understand, a little sad and sad for me all these comparisons, it is just shame and disgrace that we are dealing with this nonsense and vanity, which feeds us, and the people of Israel have to endure it, at a time when lies became truth and truth became lies. Our eyes to it. As it is written in the Psalms: """" They are poor and will not see ears and no Hear .. """" There is a state of assimilation and mixing and God forbid the disappearance of Israel and there will be no uniqueness of the people of Israel that the same Jewish people represent to the whole world and in fact all Jewish holidays, Sabbaths, Jewish celebrations, all Jewish events and everything will actually be erased, and it must not happen. Not only to the people of Israel but also to the nations of the world, which we as a nation and as a people have given to the whole world the recognition of Gd and that there is a Creator for creation, and all the various customs that accompany it, so it is inconceivable that the source of all this be erased from the map. """" There is a terrible assimilation, so at least in the Holy Land it is our duty to keep and avoid it) because in the end, at the end of the correction of the world as it is written: """" Isaiah) """" that everything depends on Israel and what is happening in the whole world """" (the Zohar), that everything actually happens because of the actions of Israel and therefore our moral and global duty, not only personal to maintain our borders and uniqueness as a people for all humanity to whom we grant it, so it is very important that we marry """" According to the religion of Moses and Israel """" which are the ones who instilled in us and us Drink the faith in one God, unique and special !! """,1
It gladdens my heart to read such things and especially from the President of the State. Learning to live together is better .. will not help either the two sides stay there and we must learn to accept each other and live yes together otherwise both sides lose .. Thank you very much esteemed President ?,0

"Mr. President, I do not know what the reactions were to this marriage, but it is clear to me that we must not greet them in their new way. AMI must preserve its character, and woe to us if the dynasty is undermined! A Jew wants to marry a Gentile - he will convert, but really! If the State of Israel does not preserve its Judaism, we are not worth any democracy!",1

"And now for something serious: the BTC (Bit Coin) I realized that it cost 10 ag in 2009, and today it is worth every single laptop (about 2300 NIS). Whoever wanted to solve the problem of benefits in the State of Israel would take any benefit of any Disabled and buying with her in 2009 the amount of BTC This would have eliminated all benefits for the entire years of life of several generations of disabled people. Each disabled person would receive from an allowance of 2000 NIS 20,000 BTC coins. Multiply by 2300 NIS (the rate is about today's) and suddenly it had: 20000 * 2300 = 46,000,000 NIS !!! And so every poor person would become a multi-millionaire ... but someone was afraid to inform the disabled about this .. lest they become influential and powerful! Because the disabled (in general disability) do not have the money to buy cellphones, computers, etc ... Even the calculation between getting to the hospital and medication and public transportation is a daily calculation for them ... at least you will grant an exemption to the disabled when traveling by public transport ...",0
But that's the problem and her choice ....,2
"Is it just weird for me not to condemn the Arabs with their racism and violence against Jews at the Games? It is impossible to condemn only one side, and certainly when the defending side is also from our side only, with all due respect this president is going to continue the path of the dumb subservience, who chose him at all.",1

"Well done to the President who came to the funeral. I'm sure he had advisers who advised in light of the circumstances, and for security reasons, not to come. But as we know Robbie Ravlio I'm sure he insisted on coming. You showed nobility when you came to pay homage to a 4-year-old boy who was murdered in front of his house. It's just a pity that none of the sages saw fit to go your way.",0
Rivlin I think you are ashamed of a country with opinions like yours you will be ashamed that your daughter will go with Arabs or terrorists but please do not speak on our behalf,1
Red line ?? Incitement ?? I have news for you. You represent the State of Israel and you incite and dishonor by supporting yesterday's wedding. There are lots of little girls who hear and internalize what you say and give them the impression that it's okay to marry an Arab. Only yesterday the bride's father cried in the media and I cried with him and you dare Wish them good luck. Shame on you and hope for you that you do not finish the priesthood.,1
A canine man (and also his wife),0
I wonder what the chairman of the Palestinian Authority would have written if an Arab girl had dared to marry a Jew !!! Democracy = Assimilation ????,1
Congratulations to the new president !! What pride for Jerusalem and the whole country!,0
What is outrageous and worrying is that you are an Ashkenazi president from Maafan ... you will not put out the flame either! The people of Israel are united against dung like you!,1
Heartbroken ...,0
"Is it not if you are a ketone in your eyes, you are the head of the tribes of Israel ... (Shmuel 1: 5: Yes) You talked about democracy, foundations, and Judaism, but among them you accidentally blessed your ovaries. The President of Israel is not supposed to congratulate those who work against the Israeli constitution, whatever your opinion is, to congratulate the newlyweds on their decision to marry. As president you have a responsibility to be careful in your language, the word to marry in this context is wrong. # fail",1
"Lol funny, what did that president do when MKs in the government spoke in a racist way and not necessarily against the people he likes? When only those who act in an extreme way in our people are condemned, do you remember waking up ??? Go back to sleep !!!",1

"Betel's, right. Why do you have to push your nose wherever it is undesirable? They just wanted to get married quietly, and it's nobody's business and no one has the right to tell them what to do. It's their choice. And if someone does not like it then it should not come as a surprise that the world hates us. Look how much we reject.",0
Long live the President of the State of Israel ??? .... and with the aspiration that the next president will not be a politician !!! Shame that the two (Dorner and Shechtman) that the public most supported received only 14 votes together.,0

Mr. President . Where are you in the picture ?? Pamper us,0
Holding fingers ... Good luck!,0
"Robbie Rivlin President. Hello ! I was very disappointed with your response and congratulations to the couple involved Morel and Mahmoud. The President of the State of Israel gives legitimacy to intermarriage ??? I ask the question if there really is a democracy why Arab women do not marry Jewish guys? After all, only as soon as he hears that she went with a Jew will she be murdered ... It is not certain that Jabotinsky will agree with a mixed marriage.",0
The country you do not read ????,1
Good luck man cooler,0
"Honorable President, your appointment is also a great consolation to the people of Israel",0
"Honorable President (actually Algae does not respect yourself) Calling for opposition to marriage between a Jew and a Gentile racism is ignorance. There is no connection between democracy and this type of marriage. Assimilation is the greatest enemy of the Jewish people throughout its generations. Therefore, I am sorry that precisely in his country (the Jewish state if I am not mistaken) such marriages receive support and those who oppose it are called racist or extremist people. In addition, the last time I examined Z. Botinsky did not write the Torah. Shame on you for being the president of our people.",1

No words The heart is pinched.,0
"Congratulations, Honorable President, but with all due respect, it is not only on the football fields that Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman called for a boycott of Israeli Arabs who went out against the war. MK Ayelet Shaked The plot that Jaffa Arabs burned a Jewish cemetery.",1

"Your Honor, as you know, the difference is great between coexistence and converting to Islam and marrying a non-Jew. It's not right for you to support it Most weddings in the past have turned Jewish girls into unhappy women. Sad you greet them",1
You're a big disappointment Robbie !! What are you trying to lick them for now? You know yourself that it hurts the Jewish people !! Would you approve of such a marriage in your home? Yes or No ? If you say yes you are hypocritical and if you say no you are lying to the people in your response regarding the wedding tonight!,1

Saying this is democracy and love. Have them successfully gave his approval. Even the previous president will not fail like this! Sorry what you said can be said leftists far from Judaism.But the president why not choose the right words where the advisers are just pulling from the waist.You would say true that marriage is against the laws of Torah Yisrael but it is the will of the couple also you are ashamed of your Judaism and feel primitive. And go on to say that there is no prohibition in the laws of democracy to prevent this marriage.

What nonsense then let's bury the values ??and the Jewish state in the name of armed democracy okay? What all of a sudden became enlightened educated and smart ??? Have you forgotten anything and do not know that Jews will be everywhere you go? After all that our people have been through the painful history and anti-Semitism that celebrates me it does not necessarily bother morale but the general idea that people have forgotten how our grandparents fought fiercely to preserve their Judaism precisely here in the Jewish state it became legitimate and a matter of name,1
"Rivlin quotes Jabotinsky to me lol Really a joke like a child in kindergarten. You will learn true Torah and you will see that assimilation is a great destruction for her family and the whole people of Israel. President of Israel quotes Jabotinsky for me on the Torah.

"June, that heat you feel in your chest when you think about your president supporting assimilation is called nerves. It takes over and turns you into his doll. You go out small, and do things without being able to stand behind them later. So regardless of the shoemaker after my brother, I'm really telling you with love, and on a personal level, it's something worth learning to put a finger on and not let him speak in your name. It's a kid with crisis problems doing, not someone who has anything real to say.It can 't be taken seriously.",1

The heart is broken on the soft child ?????? The name will rise in his blood. Feels like I know him personally some sadness.,0
Good luck wholeheartedly,0
Rivlin's father desperately wanted his son to be president but if he were alive today he would regret and be ashamed ... Rivlin will let you know that your daughter and yesterday's daughter who celebrated with the Arab are the same daughters of a righteous Jewish world creator who were lost ... and yet it does not justify agreeing with her and wishing Why congratulations ..,1
Joy for you. You Deserve .,0
"I do not know the couple who got married (today it is the wedding party and not the obligatory ceremony) but their right, their lives and I am convinced in light of the comments here, that there is a situation where there are Muslims to marry is a personal ascent, I guess whoever does not understand what democracy or modern world is, The way to curse but what is important ...",0

"in honor of the holy Sabbath ! ~! ~! ~! ~! ~! ~! ~! My credit is the winner. You too deserve unbelievable purification and an Holocaust in unbelievable shells that you even feel in your senses at the end of the speech fast !!!! Whoever does a speech fast on Shabbat and at the same time reads the Book of Psalms 3 times + 8 chapters which is 458 chapters as a quorum is guaranteed to have a pardon and not only a pardon but he makes a serious holocaust to his shells created from the iniquities !!!!! And he is considered to be fasting from Saturday to Saturday which is worth 65,606 fasts !!!!! Also station = groom. This person is guaranteed to marry his mate from the root of his soul within a year of fasting. So what is allowed and what is forbidden in the speech fast ?? It is permissible to pray, it is permissible to study Torah but only with yourself, it is by no means allowed to speak secular words !! Another important tip is to make a note with Shabbat Shalom I on a fast of speech so that if they address you directly, you can present. Post that others can win as well. Attached is a link to Rabbi Eran Ben Ezra's sermon on the subject: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6L7q63NlLSI",2

The high schools have not yet been released Mr. President!,0
Very disappointing,1
"I hope you will take office ... and when that happens, I very much hope that you will promote aid to Jews whose homes the Israeli government has destroyed. The government knows how to send humanitarian aid to the whole world and units of the Home Front Command are rescuing passengers in all kinds of disaster-stricken countries. But what about the pioneering settlers who pay a heavy price because of political games and a desire to prove to Americans that Jews are being evacuated. The situation is not simple. Leaving families with children without any clothing, welfare food or any other assistance, I hope you will work on the issue both as an MK and in Gaza as president.",0
Congratulations on your election as President,0
"Happy holiday, to the beloved couple Rivlin.",0

Finally such a president our country needs. till 120 !!!,0
Congratulations Ruby rose and success,0
Great honor is to us. Rise and succeed! Dear men .,0
Most people here talk like Germany in 1936 and it makes me nauseous,1
I expected the president of the Jewish state in Jerusalem to also say something condemning intermarriage.,1
Shabbat Shalom to you and your family,0
"Anyone who harms my country will give it back to him. Mr. President, do not change and do not forget where you came from. You came from the Likud, what now to beautify. They hurt us and we are not suckers, we will answer back. Why would they raise their heads at us and take our dignity down? No more sir.You can recommend dipped not to threaten interrogations.This is our country point they are only temporary guests here.",1
As Dana International says I won; ) Successfully,0
You know on the one hand the title of president and honor and on the other a simple person like everyone else I believe you are not seeking the honor nor the sympathy Rivlin in our cold need acts of courage deeds not done to date the people ask begging you not to spare the enemy neither the Knesset nor the murderers The lowly and despicable even if this blind world is not supposed to prevent you and us from acting contrary to what is in our hearts Oh well Mr. President Rivlin please enough to be nice where brave leadership is needed and it is worth taking decisive action against the cruel enemy,1

Ruby Rivlin is the true right of the Land of Israel. Anyone who slanders him about these things has no political side or ideology other than stupid stupidity.,0
Proud of a new president will continue to do good and pride,0
"A real Jabotinsky. Today, after they expelled the last of the sane in the Likud and instead of Dan Meridor, Benny Begin and Michael Eitan, we have Danny Danon Miri Regev and Feiglin, I am happy to remember that there are also right-wingers whose value base is still sane. In this situation, it is possible to have an Israeli internal dialogue and around it to create true unity.",0
"Mr. President, I guess before you uploaded this host you saw nails? Tell me please (because it is secret and hidden from ordinary citizens) - what is the relationship between the marriage of a Jewish woman or it has recently converted to Islam and the marriage of a Muslim Arab to a Jew? I hope yours will see real data and you will share it with us, the simple people - welcome and thank you very much in advance",1
I knew that when Rivlin became president he would spoil us. Too bad !,1
Ruby with all my appreciation to you ... I do not get such an expression from the president of a Jewish people ... Judaism must be preserved,1
Mr. Ruby Ravlin and that you know what it is like to grow into the reality of an Arab father and a Jewish mother? Too bad for leaders giving up roots so quickly maybe that's why our country looks the way it does. Today is a Sudanese evening tomorrow and everything in the name of liberalism.,1
It turns out I was wrong! The President of the State of Israel. !!!!!!,0
"What all this nonsense you wrote. Not interesting maybe CEO Beitar and all that interests me is that our president supports assimilation. There is no reason to mix the blood of the holy Jews with the chosen people with Arabs. Arabs it's cool to marry an Arab is treated like a rag so beauty that one in a million treats his wife nicely most are devil who abuse women. Assimilation is something that is not acceptable in Judaism. Who mixes the pure and the unclean, how dare you? An Arab is neither left nor right is simply an Arab. There is no Arab who truly believes that the Jewish people are the people who deserve the Land of Israel, that you are nice and say you are friends of the Jews and love them would not have prevented you from flipping us with you had a chance {not God forbid there} I am not a racist {in my opinion} For Judaism it is dangerous and doggie it is disgusting",1
"Astrology is beautiful, but Jews believe in God and not in astrology. Maimonides vehemently opposed astrology. An example of this can be seen in his Yemenite letter, in which he wrote: ""But what you saw longs for from the wisdom of the stars and the possessions that were and will be - all remove it from your heart. Your mind, as the filthy clothes are washed from their filth. According to which they are things that are not real, and are not true of the complete sages and even do not believe in the Torah, especially for the recipients of the Torah """". Maimonides also wrote in Hebrew a complete epistle in which he emphatically denies astrology - the epistle to the Marseilles audience, also called the ""Epistle to the Sages of Montefelscher on the derivation of the stars"". """,2
"Beautiful . The idea of ??shemita is based on a social attitude to the land. It is not a commodity, but according to the Bible belongs to God - ""and the land shall not be sold for nodes because the land belongs to me"" ""(Leviticus 22: 3). So if we are dealing with shemita, I would be happy if you fight against the trends of land privatization",2
You know what it seems to me that it was not he who wrote it down,1

And Jerusalem to ... a world forever,0
You are the one and only for me.,0
"Ruby Are you ready for your daughter to be your granddaughter? You will marry if an Arab. I believe not then, Your Honor. I do not think you should interfere in this sensitive issue.",1
If you were not the President you would speak differently Dear President!,1
Truth spoke and congratulations to the couple,0
Exciting and beautiful Good luck We trust you to win,0
"It will be a great honor for the state and for us, Ruby Rivlin, President of the State of Israel, long live",0
"happy holiday to you too . Also to the family of the next president. As has been said, when it is cold outside and warm in the heart, then there is only good and no pain. And as a cape hey and living beauty and golden oats of May.",0
Come on bunch of hypocrites,1
"Holding fingers to Ruby, the most deserving president",0
There is no pride in a country that incites the daughters of Israel to marry a Muslim - Mr. Makhlouf Moroccan - this country has washed your mind and turned you from a proud Jew who is faithful to the tradition of his ancestors to a disrespectful soul who does not care Shabbat Israel marries a gentile - Muslims see one like you and despise us for our disrespect - The secular Jews who came from Ashkenazi countries and established a state here on the basis of falsehood - they are the ones who cause no peace - and they are the ones who destroyed the members of the Eastern community,1
A piece of zero painted stinking how can one swear in the bible and then encourage assimilation that God will take you fast you will represent interveners not the Jewish people,1
painful,0
upside down,1
"No one will silence us ""No assimilation !!",1
"You are a mass disappointment with Israel. You were pinned on hopes that after the annihilated Peres who ""prays"" in the Vatican, a proud Jewish president came and here is your reaction to the abusive intermarriage. Many did not think to hear Shimon Peres from your throat! Honorable President !! A marriage of rodents in the existence of the Jew in the Land of Israel !! The majority of the public is not interested in """" Our common life ........ """" There is not and will not be a common life with any people in our holy land in the State of Israel, the Jewish state !! democracy ? Foreign Workers Culture !! In the constitutions of the Gentiles. We are not the people of Israel. Your language to the Gentiles and Muslims and to the souls of most people who do not feel Jews and to the citizens of the world do not eat anything other than the honor of the President I am a proud Jew and nothing more """,1

Need to gain sympathy from the hippie,0
"{21} Is not the LORD that hateth thee that I hate, and that in thy rebellion I will quarrel: {22} The purpose of hatred is to hate the enemies of mine enemies:",1
You are the most worthy man. A great family man and I'm sure you will be a great president. Align force.,0
Good luck dear man President of the next people of Israel,0

"Ami, the president of the State of Israel whose citizens are Jews, Christians and Muslims, is the president of everyone, in every choice they make. This is not domination, this is the burden of the job. We are blessed with a person who understands this - even when it goes against his personal opinion",0
There is a president in Jerusalem,0
Cheeky. What remarks against our president. disgusting . She converted to Islam the prostitute. Go to hell. What do you want from her? Over and done .,0
"Honorable President, words as a spur. It is very important that you, as a person elevated from the people, express his opinion on issues that are so divided in particular that the rights of the individual are at stake. Even if we do not agree to the right of every person to do as he pleases as long as it is in accordance with and in accordance with the law and we must protect that right.",1
Long live the President of the State!,0
We finally have a president who understands sports,0
"After the retired publication was interrogated, then one can congratulate ""Ruby's success in running for the presidency"" ...",0
"Exciting to read, where there are more such couples. Bless you and good luck.",0
Shabbat Shalom Kudos Thank you for your response on the subject of Holocaust survivors from Libya and Tunisia who immigrated after 1953 in the hope of addressing the issue as the No. 1 citizen.,0
"Rivlin, you forgot to write how much you have no problem with assimilation",1
You made a big mistake in your statements you came out as a buffer against religion and the creator of the world. There is a Creator for the world and there are laws and halakhah and you will not change it because you want to be democratic and modern (slope). Apparently the presidency has crossed your mind.,1
How good it is that you have been elected President of the State of Israel.,0
From whom did I receive and to whom to return?,1
It is good that you are trying to hide the reality in which there is no legal possibility in Israel to marry if the couple is unlucky enough to be born into two different religions.,1
"Congratulations, Mr. President, on attending the funeral and expressing support for the residents of the South. You can talk to the Prime Minister and teach him what respect and empathy seems to have forgotten",0
40 years in the grave there is no faith in the Arabs,1
"I was very happy that you were elected, but you took all the air out of me and the desire to support you when you repeat Peres' mistakes and express an opinion on an issue that is not worthy. Israel does not like to see assimilation and as our president",1
"Dear Ruby. I wholeheartedly wish you !! Yes, you are the next president of the State of Israel, you are the most worthy of all. Happy Shavuot dear man !!!",0
Everyone is free to make mistakes. She will pay for it later in life. Believes in their right to marry and make a mistake and does not wish them anything good.,1
"With the help of the name that you have, the verse ""Our sons and daughters are given to another people"" will be fulfilled """" I regret that I supported you for the presidency of the state """,1
You can send him a letter ... because he's a lawyer like you too.,0
"It is the humanity within you that sets you apart from everyone else. Joy in your choice, joy in your joy :)",0
"Wishing them lots of love, congratulations",0
Finally there is a president at least there is one righteous man in Sodom (I hope until the next inquiry),0
"This is how a president should be expressed, respecting the other first and foremost.",0
"Mr. President, this is how they talk",1
"May you continue to enjoy your grandchildren, despite all the difficulties.",0
"Dear Jew, Honorable President Mr. Reuven Rivlin Good luck !!!",0
"Mr. President Good luck in the job, I tell you that you are two drops like my older brother !!",0
"Your popularity touches my heart. Talk about rubbing salt in my wounds - d'oh! Talk to haters of hatred, Israel Katz, Miri Regev, Lieberman. Terrible what they do. The policemen under Aharonovich ... are cruel to silent demonstrators.",0
"Honorable President, you are our King.",0
Shabbat Shalom and Blessed Mr. Rivlin. God bless you .,0
He must not be silent ... he must give up his presidency ... stupidity ..,1
Good luck and good night from Jerusalem (-:,0
And set up an organization for you again. !! The organization prevents assimilation with the want to add and improve and streamline we are ready to hear understand and learn what can be fixed improve to preserve .. !! And maybe one day you will fall in love with this holy organization! Believe me no one is a racist there and we take care of all the girls of Israel .... we have no interest we act from the heart out of concern and head! Good luck to this number one organization!,1
What happened to you becoming president and becoming an award? You will deal with the incitement of the Arabs and then come up with stupid claims,1
Successfully !!,0
"Traitors of the extreme left enjoy legal immunity from left-wing law enforcement agencies, and public legitimacy - no one condemns them, not the ""right"" prime minister, not the ""state"" president, nor the other hypocrites on the right and left. The video is two and a half years old but relevant today. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjPC1CTyveA """,2
Good luck dear man !!!!,0
"Mr. President, I do not know what the reactions were to this marriage, but it is clear to me that we must not greet them in their new way. AMI must preserve its character, and woe to us if the dynasty is undermined! A Jew wants to marry a Gentile - he will convert, but really! If the State of Israel does not preserve its Judaism, we are not worth any democracy!",1
"One who converts to Islam and betrays her people and her family has no place with us and that's her problem I think she's a fool who posted this to attract attention and she's so proud of it, no need to make a fuss",1
True words that come from the heart inside of a loving and loyal wife and wife to a long-loved one. Good luck to Ruby Rivlin and wish him the 10th President of the State of Israel. Amen .,0
"A red line passes between freedom of expression and left-wing demonstrations against the IDF in time of war, a red line passes between freedom of expression and Arab Knesset members who insult and incite within the Knesset itself. With all due respect to the President before you rush to justify assimilation in polished words please give your mind to the rest of the things I have written.",1
"Guy, where we will not talk about right or left neither religious nor secular only facts. How for about two thousand years we managed to stay as a people while everyone else dissolved ?! Just because of a rigid set of rules that left no room for assimilation with the environment. Now you are coming under the guise of an enlightened Israeli and want to make our people dissolve like the rest of the nations! Yes Guy, we are special even if it sounds racist to you then yes we are the race of the Jewish people and should not be ashamed of it these are just proud! And if we go back to the left and the right then the right understands that the left is renouncing it because it is exiled and cowardly.",1
Let them leave quietly This is their choice and time will do its thing to have thousands more like them,0
"Good time! And good luck! Many blessings and best wishes for your election, Your Excellency, President of the State of Israel! Continue to be that wonderful person! Witty! Sympathetic and beloved! Pleasant !",0
"I can no longer ignore what has been happening to us lately .. Religious coercion, racism .. We are on the way to being Iran ... Where freedom of choice, freedom of religion and individual freedom is already dangerous to live here..the sad flame organization that the court allowed to demonstrate must be condemned.",0
"I would like to wish the President Shabbat Shalom, I have never been as excited as I was on the day of your election as President. I wish you and your family good luck and good news to all the people of Israel. His Sabbath",0
May you know only a greeting of honor and rest from the grandchildren from Brock and much success to the President of the State of Israel - you deserve it,0
Blessed and happy Shabbat,0
With us the whole family did,0
We need to live together ... possible with wanting everyone wants to make a living working and living quietly. We need to teach the people that is possible. Once we were together everything was fine Hamas will not break us [I hope],0
It is a great honor for the people of Israel that you are their number 1 citizen,0

"Dear Mr. Robbie Ravlin, fuck you idiot",1
Honorable President. We did not get to see the swearing-in ceremony. The truth is that we actually wanted to but we had unclosed businesses in the south. Is it possible to request that the entire ceremony be uploaded to the Internet? Good luck in Hadar and Gaon (,0
"Rabbit lowers the truth will not say eh ??? !!! ??? ""Jabotinsky writes"" ""What about Gd writing ???? What about Gd explicitly forbidding in the Torah a mixed marriage and no matter the results we see since they communicate near brothers"" ""Let's save me and my children"" ""By the way there was not It's the assimilation that kept us as a Jewish people for 2000 years we are in exile and almost all the Jews did not assimilate come we think if they were married to German French etc where were the Jews today we would come back here ??? Rivlin are you blind you think democracy is God but I renew to you that I believe in God One and not other idols and if you do not want an Arab majority here from most marriages and culture and the state will change from Israel to Palestine and the rest of the Jews who will be here will be thrown into the sea then start waking up !!! Because Arabs do not care Micho starts with a Muslim! What will happen to him !!! """,1
Make blessings of God,0
Honorable to the Honorable President.,0
Udi is right,2
Congratulations and good luck Mr. Robin Rivlin,0
Some respect for what our dear president has is not allowed to express an opinion we live in a democratic country,0
rise and succeed !! There is a lot of work ahead of you to preserve the goodness and power of the reciprocity we are experiencing in these significant days.,0
"You have friends, a great blessing from the Holy City of Safed, Ltd. This week is all yours,",0
This is the irresponsible government for the residents. Why let them go back to the fire area. The country's southern refugees! irresponsible,1
Shit I always hated your crooked opinions !!! Too bad Meir Sheetrit did not defeat you ..,1
Good luck and you will succeed,0
Honorable President I encourage you to see in this post how much garbage there is in the country how much racism and evil. Start with that and start by catching the racists giving them a fine and paying for the garbage they take out of their mouths. Uncultured bastards.,1
Let them return soon to him,0
"My dear friend Honorable Tenth President of the State of Israel, I was very happy to choose you and feel the happiest in the world because at the end of the process a wise person with vision and vision and many years of work was chosen and succeeded and I am sure you will represent our dear State of Israel with great respect, proud of you and keep in touch Good and warm as usual for more than a decade, good luck later.",0
Of blessed memory,0
It's beautiful ....,0
Probably all the comfort grandmothers are alike,0
A canine woman,0
Well done honestly well done well done!,0
Robbie Rivlin Listen well! .. You are not my president !!! And it is better for your semen to close so that less garbage comes out of it !!!,1
That a president in the Land of Israel will give backing to assimilation ... This is itself a very serious rushing disease ... without beautification of the soul ... There is a Torah for the people of Israel before a morbid democracy that blurs the identity of the Jew.,1
Successfully . There is no one worthy of you.,0
"Thank you, Your Excellency, for this post with the Zionist spirit. Good and quiet Shabbat to you too!",0
"Honorable President, now I can say, there is a president in Jerusalem! Thank you for (attempting) to bring sanity back to the country! And congratulations to the new couple.",0
Happy holiday to the dear man,0
Of blessed memory,0
Guys see you did not grow up as a Jew!,2
Congratulations to Ruby and good luck and comfort I never know you We never met and saw you on TV today For the first time you are seen as a supportive and humble woman reminiscent of the generation of elephants who was and is no more I wish you and your husband good health and longevity Beyond that I am convinced that an excellent president is elected The president will stand by his side as a wonderful first lady and direct strength and success to the presidential couple.,0
Amen ..,0
All you need is a government that legally thinks Tel Aviv is enveloping Gaza.,1
"Dear Jew, I knew that your honor would be the President's success !!!!!!!",0
Why would anyone make fun of a black actor?,1
The people have only one request from you. Please lower the budget of the President's House and transfer the wasted money to the dying Holocaust survivors. Show us that your custom is different from that of your predecessor. Thank you : ),0
"Yael German The people of Israel Bush from public representatives like you is cut off from the roots and past of the people of Israel who encourage assimilation in the name of pluralism during two thousand years of exile The people of Israel prayed to return to their homeland How many soldiers fell in Israeli systems for defending the homeland for the Jewish people Why and why? In order to assimilate and convert to Islam in our country, woe to the people in question, they are its leaders, and woe to the people in question, they are the sons of Luli the armies, he left us almost a remnant - A widow will not come to them .. There is no doubt that worldviews like yours are a sure recipe for the future !!! """,1
Come on..they are shooting at us..they are kidnapping us..they are killing us. And we ask to pray. Friends Halasssss..it's the Middle East..wake up..not to mention eliminate them already,0
"Good evening to the Rivlin family. After reading what your partner wrote .... now I want the consolation for the first lady !!! So to the Rivlin couple, with wholehearted success.",0
"I heard yesterday and remained captivated by the moving speech you delivered in the Knesset. I wish you great success in your role and that during your tenure, the unification and Likud of the people and the rapprochement of hearts will increase. And who will give and also get to lead peace with our neighbor.",0
"Well done to you President of the State, I have loved and appreciated every word and word, indeed a distinction must be made between a personal opinion and what is agreed upon whether in law or in any other way. Align force",0
How much fun in the soul with such love,0
"Oh how many discussions and arguments we had about it yesterday ..... and it's unbelievable that it got to the president. It is simply false to say that Maccabi's audience is like that. We love Rady and 99.9% of the audience is not racist. I would not give such weight to some poor (really kids) poor and crippled children, who just want to destroy. It just does not make sense that it has reached such dimensions it does not deserve us. Rady is a tool for those kids to get some treatment from the management no more. We had Arab actors in the past and there will be more in the future, why didn't they say that we also cursed them on racial grounds? Because it's just not true and the Hapoel / Haaretz fan's sympathetic media ""just distorts facts. Now it's already a snowball and go convince otherwise. Come on Maccabi! ????""",1
What came out of one who was a fan of Betar Jerusalem,1
How heartbreaking,0
"Truth, Honorable President, truly a great speech! Exciting! But I'm really interested to know what would have happened if one of your daughters had decided to do the same. Still I agree that not everyone must rejoice in their joy, but must in their honor",1
Good luck and lots of personal and national happiness in this honorable role!,0
Very nice Robbie Rivlin Our next president visited the family of the slain ...... rose and success Mr. President,0
"A president who calls for protest and expression of pain over assimilation in the Land of Israel, incitement and racism, is not my president.",1
"Good luck, finally a smiling and welcoming president",0
"Well done sir. We must not let extremists, who do not understand that we are all here stay, not even a quiet moment, racists must be persecuted on both sides until they are silenced and return to their wretched holes.",0
Good luck to our president.,0
Long live the President of the State!,0
You Deserve !!!!,0
You're a huge man.,0
Matan Gur will see what a king,0
Congratulations on your election as the 10th President of the State of Israel. A great honor is due to us from the extended Amar family from Tiberias,0
"Why do judges in the courts and lawyers not have to go through mirroring machines that despise what comes at the gates of the court and even constitute a cause of illness ... while the citizen does have to go through them as if they were already put in a category that is not equal among equals as well as a potential suspect ... Yours sincerely, President",1
Ofir baruch - you are not right because you probably do not have Arab friends otherwise you would have had a more moderate opinion - even the bartender has Arab friends and a specific speaker - anyway you will try Arabs who also love Jews and have no problem with Jews and here live together in almost everything!,1
Sweet child !!! so sad ...,0
"BH you had to learn from Samuel and Saul, even if you are small and miserable in your own eyes, Gd puts you in this role and it does not matter what stupid thoughts you go through in the little intellect you have. And you owe the honor of the people of Israel according to the Torah and Gd. And if you consider yourself a Jew, then know that the Torah is against assimilation. And do not quote Jabotinsky who hated religious Jews and especially ultra-Orthodox and his declared opinion of them is known. And he is certainly not authoritative about the Torah. And what about a man who hates his brother and loves the enemies of his family. And I do not wish them to divorce when they are not married anyway and I hope she opens her eyes and repents and separates from the Gentile. You also need to repent because you have angered many of the people of Israel and you should know that Gd does not like to speak ill of his eldest son.",1
Align power! Every word carved in stone,0
"Honorable President, your prayers and requests will be received at the gates of heaven, Shabbat Shalom and a good month.",0
Strong and blessed to the dear President of the State Mr. Rivlin Good luck along the way who will only be pleased with your grandchildren in Gaza,0
Thanks ! You are an island of insanity of our leadership! And thank you for coming to wrap Gaza in our most difficult days!,0
"This is about assimilation, it is not a matter of incitement. We are a Jewish people and a people chosen by the Creator of the world and it hurts that Shabbat Yisrael marries an Arab",1
"Well done !! Truly a president of glory, yes, multiply like you and live in a land of peace and equality. May it be so ..",0
Honorable President! Respect to you !!!,0
And I thought a man would come out and release Yigal Ami. Be ashamed of yourself,1
"It would be better if you did not interfere in this shame that we have a president like you, I will waste.",1
"Definitely the most deserving man to be the tenth President of the State of Israel, ours! Warm congratulations and lots of success and good health ...",0
"You do not need a dear man, show everyone what a good president you are and be honest.",0
May you have many years and enjoy your grandchildren as much as possible,0
I'm so sad and hurt that it's hard for me to read this,0
Better than foreign players.,1

Lovely !! We are honored that you are our next president ?? Good luck and good luck with ease !!,0

Oh Shion dear Mr. Reuben I wonder what he would say about that in Behu,1
"Blessed be the President of the State of Israel, beloved of the people.",0
Congratulations dear Ruby Rivlin,0
"Fuck you, you bastard, why am I peeing in your direction at all? Ya piece of idiot shit on you and another hundred like you and your blessings wish your family Yallah go ride before I kick you in the head",1
You managed to fill with respect the huge shoes that Shimon Peres left you !!!,0
And why not also show the voice of the father of the bride in heartbreak pleading that his house will not be assimilated? This is racism that shows only one side of the coin!,1
I wonder what you would write if your daughter would choose to marry an Arab or your son would choose the Arab nipple for a woman,1
Well done !,0
"May his memory be blessed, may God avenge his blood",1

If in London an Englishman wants to marry a Jew and Englishmen will protest against it ... we will all be shocked by the anti-Semitism. So why does the shock only work when it's against us. Wishing them good luck and good luck and love will win!,1
Israeli Shemita,2
"Well little Rivlin to me ""President"" ""You are not !! And all your use of Jabotinsky is absolutely despicable this man hated Judaism and it is not new to you read some material about him and look in the mirror again!""",1
Rivlin is simply ashamed on your part to support the exaggeration this time,1
Good luck in your role as President of the State! And a warm greeting to the sweet grandson Shai! There is no doubt that he causes a lot of smiles .. Hagit is a teacher of movement and sports,0
"Well done for the connection to tradition, the honor of the President.",0
"How can the President of the State of Israel open his mouth in favor of such trouble ?! Did you see the father's video? Do you know what it is for him? It's worse than sitting seven, knowing that your daughter is alive and living in an Arab neighborhood / village and a Muslim maid I would rip a shirt off. I believe you know what the girls who converted to Islam and chose this way go through on the other side, most of them eventually return to the real house. You know in yourself that this is a shocking thing and you speak like a beautiful soul because you ""president"" want to please everyone but that is a lie !!! Shame you are encouraging it. When it comes to the gate of this narrow house you will understand Morel's father. Next time you will really write down what you think and not write down anything to come out beautiful! Be as real as a prize.",1
"Who would have believed that about two weeks after the late Daniel honored you on his visit, you are today honoring him in his final way. Just heartbreaking.",0
People like you are already in the trap of mystery !! The future for religious Jews because only they make children for your information !!!! Traitor !!!!,1
Honorable President! The beautiful Land of Israel! You are sure to bring honor to the country from the President's House! Successfully !,0
"Ruby Reuven Rivlin - Great picture, great post. Our President well done. I liked .",0
"Sabba, does this also apply to same-sex marriage? Divorced and Cohen? Cohen and a convert? Or in these things does darkness still rule the State of Israel?",0
Well done to you Honorable President. Thank you so much for such important things.,0
"You're a right-wing peacock, she's got power, she's left. Like a chameleon, she changes colors according to the environment.",1
"Thank you very much for the comments, exciting :)",0
What a president,0
Jews and Muslims are blood enemies !!!!!!,1
"Congratulations, from Brock to the new president Ruby and wish you success in office.",0
"Amazing, oh ha who's this coming Rivlin next president.",0
And this is called taking a traditional Jewish value and connecting it to today's reality. Charming.,1
Amen yes there will be a will.,0
Shabbat Shalom to the one and only president !!! And to the whole special family,0
"Woe to us because we are broken. After all, it is clear to us that we are facing the vile and cruel murderers, so we need a real and determined Jewish government that will immediately launch an operation at the level of at least a wall and a shield. But I do not believe that it is in the power and wisdom of our government to act with determination and consideration for the Gentiles. This is also the time to act with all our might against the oppressors of the country and its enemies - the fifth conscript among us. We should not plan the abduction of the terrorist Hanin Zoabi or that of Saleh Rudd, but take immediate action against them with the determination and full force we hope we still have.",1
"Sincerely, The President is proud of you",0
Shabbat Shalom !!!,0
Disappointment Reuven Rivlin,1
"There is no need to wish these villains anything. Democracy requires allowing them to get married, but best wishes are already a matter beyond democracy. It is not possible for the President of the State of Israel to wish ""health peace and joy"" ""to a Jew who marries an Arab. Too bad.""",1
Let us not know!,1
Love you Honorable President Blessing and success,0
"You mean, like, saltines and their ilk, eh?",1
What fun and easy to hear these things! Thanks !,0
"Tell me, Guy, are you a Jew at all? Who are you anyway? ? Do you know what uproots the Torah and religion and what is not? ?? The last time you attended a religious ceremony was in your covenant .. ""And you will not marry them"" ""Do you know?? Certainly not. You are a wicked villain"" ""He will close the account with all of you. Remove worry ...""",1
"I and all my friends who have supported you for many, many years are disappointed with your unacceptable position on the majority of the people, including the ministers ......",1
Better a prime minister than a president,1
Disgusting leftists / evening,1
Well done Honorable President !!! Well spoken,0
What a torn heart nerve,0
"Ganem Bwerat - This was not your land. Never. And never will be. You have 22 countries, you have to decide where to go. You migrated here, found a job, saw that it was good and chose to stay. In none of the Arab countries will you have what you have here - freedom of expression, work. Do you live here, enjoy all the good and dare to open your mouth and pour out your poison? Can we make peace with you? Barbarians. Life in Gaza is miserable because of ""leaders"", Alec leaders. Those leaders do not dare to come out of their hiding place and the wonderful conditions they have, but they scatter the poison to you and incite you. Have you seen what they do to people from Gaza? Have you seen what they do to women in Afghanistan and Iran? You choose to live so you have the opportunity to leave. And certainly not to return here. Shame that you live here, despise everything that is given to you, but think that everything is due to you. Rejoice that soldiers fall in battle? Well, I'm sorry for the wording but with you one goes twenty Are you sanctifying death? We are sanctifying life. Hamas is a murderous terrorist organization whose methods are cruel and disgusting even against the Arab people. Belongs to the Jewish people from generation to generation and will be forever !! The people of Israel live forever in their land. You have no place here even though we try to live with you in coexistence. He who has a desire to achieve much and more and more, ends up left with nothing. Disgusting. """,1
The problem that only one side wants peace The other side wants to throw you into the sea Understood this Honorable President,1
Unnecessary institution with unnecessary expenses and unnecessary conferences. Not to mention unnecessary salaries. The most legal theft of taxpayers.,1
Well done to you Honorable President.,0
"Ruby, every word in the rock! I'm with you!",0
You're the only one worthy of Brock Bibi on your nose and in your wrath Ruby chosen You can get the hat of justice Made of Brock from Brooke Ruby President of Israel,0
"A pleasant, safe and relaxed vacation ... with the help of the name, the boys will return in peace .....",0

"It's not just that you are a sentimental person, your heart is so big and your humanity is indescribable, it remains only to say - long live the people who are its president.",0
The hesitant Prime Minister is a weak defense minister and a cowardly chief of staff are the ones who led to the murder of this child - - - hope to hear your voice say this and out loud !!!!!!!!!! You are not an ordinary politician you are the president of the country,0
"We suffered for seven years in order. Finally win our dog president !! Honest, beloved and dear president !!",0
"I very much appreciate your response regarding the marriage of Mahmoud and the morale of the Honorable President, I hope your position will influence the belligerent public opinion in the country, indeed we all owe it to them.",0
Respect! Honorable President!,0
"Good luck to you, the President and his wife will honor our people",0
Honorable President-elect I remember we were together at the funeral of Grandpa Meir Ohad Beitar I always held from you a man before politics strong and adopted,1
The most exciting election in the history of President-elect! Long live the President! There is nothing more worthy of you! And no less exciting is your wife's reaction to your victory! Ruby loves you,0
Well done !,0
Shame on you President of the Jewish State Alak if we were married if Arabs Abu Mazen would order us to be slaughtered and her if he ruled here,1
"Really disappointing, I would like to know if your home would have upheld ""Freedom of Liberty"" ""Were you in favor too ??""",1
Terrible and terrible pain. May his memory be blessed,0
"A president who calls for protest and expression of pain over assimilation in the Land of Israel, incitement and racism, is not my president.",1
"The right person, in the right place, align strength, successfully, your success the success of us all,",0

No words,0
"A real Jabotinsky. Today, after they expelled the last of the sane in the Likud and instead of Dan Meridor, Benny Begin and Michael Eitan, we have Danny Danon Miri Regev and Feiglin, I am happy to remember that there are also right-wingers whose value base is still sane. In this situation, it is possible to have an Israeli internal dialogue and around it to create true unity.",0
"Honorable President of the State. The will of man is his honor, and this is how a democratic state should behave. But this is a father who calls his daughter a desperate call to accept with a committee to reverse her decision. No person has the right to interfere or deny the right of the father to express his position. At the same time as democracy, we have the values ??of the Iron Flock: ""Respect your father and your mother."" I personally am not interested in this story, but the father cries out to his daughter in order to preserve the values ??of Judaism and her Jewish identity. No citizen of the country has the right to interfere in this matter. And if we are dealing with violence; There is extremely severe violence on the part of the far left and extremist Arabs, who call for the destruction of Israel, who distribute swastikas, constantly curse and insult the IDF and express joy at the fall of our soldiers on the battlefield. Suffice it to say that violence originates on the right, on the contrary.",1
Shabbat Shalom . Who will give and the boys will be found in peace.,0
"Honorable President, since you were elected president, your right-wing tendency has been declining. We do not like Arabs, and that's how it will remain.",1
This is what interests our president at such a terrible time,1
"Honorable President, you forgot to open the post with ""Peace from Jerusalem.""",0
"And Your Honor, you do not have to comment on everything. You would do well to fill your mouth with water on this issue. It has already been said, ""Sage to wisdom is silent."" ""Sometimes we need to know when to be silent. Well, maybe we are looking for wisdom where it is not?""",1
"Ruby, stop being stately, from this bullshit, stop bowing to the media. Be who you are in real life, !! And by the way, the court allowed you to demonstrate, so do not talk about incitement.",1
Shabbat Shalom and lots of success in the presidential election !!,0
"Good luck Robbie dear man, may you have an interesting and challenging term. There is no country more deserving than you to be president.",0
Confident in your success as President ...,0
"Ruby Hamudi tells you just im you are a person egon as you tell us so it is better that you work to cancel the conversion that escaped today that will strive to pass this bill in favor of those who have no food at home im in general have a home for 3 year olds so they can live their last third with dignity She ran away today thanks to the taxes they paid all their lives and now there is no commotion and you, Ruby, are afraid that you are already a cabbage for their age.",0

Congratulations to the bride.,0
Happy Holidays to you and your family and wish you and all the people of Israel blessed with your presidency,0

Thank you Ruby for bringing the voice of the sane majority to the forefront of the Israeli public.,0
"You're a scumbag, Your Honor",0
Strengthen your hands,0
Omri you are really ashamed of your belligerent reactions. Maybe think for a moment before you take such slime out,1
The cutest couple in the country! Ruby and Nehama the people love you! Happy holiday !,0
How human is our president,0
"Do you understand that she has already converted to Islam? before the wedding ? That they are already married and now this is just the party after? A human right to freedom of choice, especially in a democratic state. The right of the people to protest and demonstrate, to try to open the eyes of the people. As long as it is done legally. And the president? His job is to try and bridge the gap between the different people and to remind everyone that Derech Eretz preceded the Torah, and even if we do not agree ideologically in fact, after all it is her choice and should be respected.",0
cute,0
"What a beauty ! Happy with your joy! You forgot, Mr. President, to mention in this post Jerusalem our capital, does not suit you :-)",0
Mr. Tenth President,0
"We have a president. On a painful issue as much as it is the values ??of democracy must be above. There is no room for free hatred and racism even if it is about difficult issues and sensitive periods. Respect for faith lies in its place but please do not be required to run the country that way. We will not wish for a state of halakhah and will not agree to one. Like many here, for me the situation may cause discomfort. But this is the challenge of being a free man in a democratic society. Not all Arabs are enemies. Remember, a person is not responsible for his origin he is responsible for his actions.",1
Master artist Shabbat Shalom,0
"Sincerely, Mr. President .... A clear statement ...",0
"Friends, we are not Hamas. We will moderate the reactions. Some culture and control fortified. Fans of the mezuzah weapons, read what is written in the Torah about the Hagar who lives in our country. The army is doing its job successfully and we will become human beings worthy of this glorious army.",0
"Shabbat Shalom to our President,",0
Be content,0
Congratulations to our new President Blessed Artist,0
Amen,0
I also hope for you and wish our next president Shabbat Shalom,0
Good luck dear and huge man love you ??????????,0
Not pretty,1
Amen and amen .,0
"Honorable President, Is the value of democracy more important than the preservation of the Jewish people, the State of Israel spends millions in understanding the Jews of the Diaspora to Israel in order to prevent the assimilation and extermination of the people. Whereas here in the State of Israel, the home of the Jewish people, the state allows for the assimilation and erasure of the people !! Yes, the next generation of this couple will no longer be Jewish, and so will all generations later, although their children are Jewish, but they will grow up in an environment hostile to Judaism and the state (see films of Jaffa Arabs marching with wizard flags during Operation Eitan). It is a pity that the president of the Jewish state lends a hand to the actual extermination of the people. Sad!",1
Amen . so sad,0
"Danniel qeletti You probably know the sentence and you are saved for your souls. It does not exactly meet the values ??of life in Gaza. Every mother and father in Gaza wants to be martyrs and their children. In contrast, we have a supreme value for human life and every loss is great. In Gaza",1
Shabbat Shalom President of the State of Israel How happy there is in the whole country a lot of success,0
"From today I do not contribute to the rescue of the girls who married Arabs, so we have to take risks to save them, whoever marries an Arab who knows her blood is in her head and there is no savior, prayers will not help her either",2
I write a lot so you can be sure to see it,1
"Reuven Rubi Rivlin - Reuven Rubi Rivlin, we counted with you !!",0
"How sweet, how sweet.",0
"Indeed it is evident in you that within you as a blessed one you will be blessed from the mouth of the Most High and may blessing and success be a worthy and worthy person for our country a president like you and the verse will be fulfilled in you ""and found grace and good understanding in the eyes of God and man"".",0
You are the next president of the State of Israel,0
If it was possible to mark more than one lake I would mark a thousand,0
"In all service, Jews fought against assimilation. There can be no situation in which the President of the State of Israel encourages assimilation, so it has lost the moral ground to be the President of the State of the Jews.",1
"From grandfather to grandfather, well done. And may you have the strength to land.",0
You're president! We are not interested in your opinion! A president by constitution is apolitical and all your stupid status is shrouded in pious politics. Be ashamed and soon with your granddaughters.,1
Pray and hope for peace and unity,0
Amen and amen !,0

Blessed be the honor of the President,0
"I do not know the couple who got married (today it is the wedding party and not the obligatory ceremony) but their right, their lives and I am convinced in light of the comments here, that there is a situation where there are Muslims to marry is a personal ascent, I guess whoever does not understand what democracy or modern world is, The way to curse but what is important ...",0
"It's been a long time since we had such a warm and modest first lady, congratulations !!",0
"Rinat First of all I registered as a smoker I did not mean drugs !!! I meant cigarettes so keep your mouth shut !! Because it can cost you dearly .. and here tomorrow they are getting married Martin & Israel is French no? Go demonstrate in the hall !! Because of the scum of a man like you there is this disgusting handful who swears his mouth towards our president a man in his own right !!! And I say that you do not deserve to be a resident of the State of Israel !! Her right to do what she wants as you chose to be a dumb girl and no one demonstrates outside your home !! And Didi? This is the President of the State of Israel, he must express an opinion !!!",1
"I do not understand the great fuss around it, it interests me ass her life that she will do what she wants",2
Good thoughts for boys who will return in peace. And may our people unite not only in times of trouble.,0
Love you Ruby. success,0
If all due respect to the president of assimilation is taboo,1
how sad ...,0
So probably the dream will last a long time ...,1
Who will take care of the kindergarten children: - (,0
"I wonder if you, Ruby, will also be asked to make a capital statement about your activities and assets ... or is there something that has paved your way ...",0
Little Tamblon people ... The first sentence is: a long time ago I signed an Eddie card .... not now. The idea in the post of our elected president is to raise awareness. And it's nice that he publishes after the election and not before ...,0
Good luck holding your fingers and waiting for your choice !. Yours wholeheartedly,0
Congratulations and good luck,0
This is called encouraging assimilation as long as he does not protest,1
I have to correct some common mistake everywhere on the subject of marrying an Arab ... and people emphasize the issue she will be a slave. You will be beaten. That's not the issue at all. Because good or bad husbands are not related to religion or nationality it is found in all sectors. We are here discussing Islamization. About going over the Torah of Moses. About marrying a gentile. To marry if a person who is not of the seed of Jacob our father. Her child will be called Muhammad Mahmoud What a Jewish mother can call her son instead of Avraham Yitzchak Yaakov Moshe Aharon Mahmoud Mahmoud Come eat and it is important to add that all these relations between Arabs and Jews are also read because of the joint schools that study together,1
"Regardless of the ""victory celebrations"". A space that is an only child is a terrible family holocaust. """,1
There was no more worthy candidate. Congratulations.,0
Ruby will die today with God's help,1
Shabbat Shalom and blessed with good news,0
Enough with the racism. This is the private life of the couple.,0
That all the Arabs will make atonement for all the people of Israel,1
Your mother is on me below me in front of me,1
"What happened ? Since you became president you have started flattering Arabs! Shame on you ! Then she will be beaten to death, to whom will she turn? You ??",1
Good luck dear couple! Want to see you at the Presidential Institution an hour that suits you ...,0
"Ruby, after your words, it is difficult for me to call you the President of the State of Israel, I loved and supported you, but your words about the Jaffa couple hurt you severely. You humiliated yourself, even if you thought it was not necessary to express harm not only to yourself but also to the presidency.",1
I repeat in every Assyrian forum that generalizations must not be made regarding the Arab citizens of the State of Israel,0
No agreements are made with Satan. The devil is destroyed,1
"Honorable President, you deserve it! You got the job of being number 1 honestly",0
Up to 120 as a 20-year-old man.,0
I would like to see if this was the daughter of President Rivlin. What would he say,1
"Stop expressing an opinion, it's not your job, your job is to extort money from us and live like a king without expressing an opinion. It seems that the role of the president has also become political, oh, I wish the suspicions against you would be adjusted and maybe luckily finally close this fucking job for nothing.",1
Good luck President,0
"This is a president! Keep it up, Robbie. The sane majority is behind you.",0
good luck,0
If a president like you does not need enemies go fuck all you stinking leftists and I wish your granddaughters dear Ruby Rivlin would go to some village to live if an Arab stinks and we will see you talking like that shame !!!!!!!!,1
May his memory be blessed,0
Shabbat Shalom President Ruby Rivlin. This is when they are born in Ramla,0
Shame on you . As a Jerusalemite and as someone who supported you - I am disappointed in you. Ready to sell the values ??of Judaism and support assimilation just to maintain a state image ?? That is why you were chosen as the President of the State of Israel ?? If you did not understand that you were expected and expected to replace Peres not only in the Tabernacle but also the spirit that ministered in it - do yourself and us a favor and resign. One prize was already more than enough!,1
Grandpa was honored successfully and straightened up,0
To change the name to the next president: one of the people.,0
I loved wishing success!,0
Friends this reference against the President of the State is out of place and should be done as to what politics and the situation have to do with the private life of the couple and will all those who are going to demonstrate today help them?,0
In my opinion there is nothing more worthy than you !!! Successfully .,0
Amen ! May we be privileged to see the Jerusalem building!,0
What a grandfather figure !! Huge Lake !!,0
"A militant group is developing here whose explicit purpose is to cause a rift and tension between us and the Arabs of the country, in my opinion their activity should be cut short when they are still in diapers. They are similar to those who do price tags in secret and in the dark, and they do so under the auspices of the media. They must not be given a stage even in the name of democracy and freedom of speech .. that they talk as much as they want but do not have to press them and invite them every time to TV .. If peace activists we should ignore them aggressively because they want to destroy Jewish-Arab relations!",1
a big man !!,0
I'm proud of you my dear president!,0
Good visit to you lovely family hi only Ruby will be our president I pray for him and success artist,0
Align the Honorable President!,0
You encourage the assimilation of shame that you are the bearer of a Jewish state and I was also happy that she was elected so that the Betar man would reach the most honorable pocket in our country. You do not add respect to him or the Betar Zionist movement.,1
"It is worth starting with a real action such as the non-entry of Syrian citizens for medical treatment - we are neither America nor Europe, and can not afford to treat the wounded of an enemy state, when we have hungry children, especially the Syrians are photographed after a victory and mockery of Israel. We're tired of funding enemies!",2
I always ask myself what you're doing there at the President's House all day and I'm talking about moving to Grandpa and all sorts of things,0
Shabbat Shalom to you and your family dear man,0
People are dying in the south and you're talking about shemita. What planet do you live on?,1
The hallucinatory response. Ask each Arab if he is part of the Israeli experience and we will see what the answers are. I also condemn such readings,1
"Honorable Speaker of the Knesset, what is your position on the matter? The morbidity rate in Haifa is among the highest in the country! The authorities claim that it has nothing to do with factories. Every sensible person understands that this is a lie of interested people https://www.facebook.com/events/1450445031876122/",0

"With all due respect to you, and there. This time I do not agree with you. And the fact that Jabotinsky wrote something does not mean that it is a Torah for Moses from Sinai. So what . I also wrote a lot of things. A Jewish state is first and foremost a Jewish one. And as a minister, I would be careful not to make such a thing legitimate. With all that I think they have a free choice. There are still things that the Arabs guarantee to each other, and the Arabs think it is right to intervene and save. It is no different from suicide. If someone commits suicide, it is imperative to intervene. Sometimes it's the same thing.",1
"I would love to know a little more about the omission of funds, the economic Sabbath as you call it. While in the country 1.8 million poor people are counted and others who are not counted (on second thought none of them are counted are mostly transparent), is there a chance to omit their debts and give them an economic dome to recover as the land renews itself?",1
Successfully !!!!,0
"Interesting Zuri, you want to protest about how you talk to the president but you yourself write in a belligerent and threatening way. And I have not yet talked about your spelling errors ...",1
Amen,0
"Nice statuses on Facebook I too can post, with all due respect. This wedding is under real physical threat, and the president can do little more than send greetings on Facebook. And if he chooses to stay only in the realm of statements, then perhaps a commitment that there will be no pardon for any of Gupstein's rioters caught tonight in a heinous act of violence?",1
". The 10th President of the State, Reuven Rivlin, a man of Jerusalem, has nothing like you to bring about unity with Israel and the Land of Israel.",0

"Mr. President, what about all the distracting leftists and Arabs who turn away to murder and harm Jews all the time and the police do not use the same force and power only against children and women in evacuating Jewish communities? You heroes, we thought you were different, but in the end you are all leftists.",1

""Indeed, just as it is not acceptable for us to curse and chant racist chants against a Jewish actor abroad, alas for us if We behave this way towards an Arab actor (or a cleaner or a security guard or a cook or a professor or anything else of Russian or Ethiopian or Asian descent or anything perceived as """" not ours """").

"Assimilation is a very sad and bad thing for the Jewish people, yet incitement and racism over the decisions of an adult who takes responsibility for his life, and I am sure she has been confronted with all the possible Jewish and personal emotional and mental consequences and this is her choice. She takes her destiny into her own hands like each and every one, and it may be sad to say that she was chosen to do this act. For this she must respect her decision, wish her all the best and that she may become an ambassador of goodwill for coexistence. Educate your children who know not to come to this place at all!",0
The President is right and I strengthen his hands - these are exactly the words of the noble and true Betar citrus - which unfortunately most of the public do not know today,0

"People The president has not chosen a position and he is right - this is the basis of this country and these are the values ??we have set for ourselves, from this we can conclude that if this basis is undermined, the whole structure will fall! All the shame and hatred makes you ""dirty"" your president and slander him too. Every human being makes ""mistakes"" in his life and learns from them and as we all remember our childhood - no matter how much we are begged, we still do. It's her choice (even if ""dumb"") and we have no right to interfere. What's more, as many opponents as possible cause rebellion and go against sanity. Come on down to the subject - there are more important things! post Scriptum . Regarding the terrible wishes - that her parents will take care of the issue and deal with it! Certainly not by inciting even more against this girl, it's hard for her dad anyway!",1

"Monday - Good Week and Congratulations Elijah the Prophet is well remembered in honor of the Prime Minister, well His Excellency wrote this week ""Our policy is simple, get up early to kill him ..."" "". Beautiful, almost accurate quotes from the sources. The source is """" coming to kill early to kill """" from the Gemara (Blessings of Noah 1: 2; 2: 2). There is no doubt that Benjamin, the Likud of their homes, will pay a very heavy price for the helplessness in security, the release of terrorists, surrender on the Temple Mount, Qassams and missiles every day (even tonight !!!), giving and giving, and now child abductions! Therefore, we ask you to act as Prime Minister of Israel, (and this does not mean to appear in the media and inform the people about the abduction, and in fact to thank the failure of your governments who bow to the enemy every day), that is: - to immediately resolve the failure of internal security, narrow Aharonovich His failures every day on the Temple Mount, and spitting on the people of Israel who pay him, and expelling Jews from the Temple Mount every day, the opposite of what he is supposed to do, expel terrorists and rioters! And now children are also being kidnapped in broad daylight! The people of Israel are not willing to pay for such a submissive failure not for one more second! And we would not rule out criminal action against him at all, by virtue of his responsibility! Decide to be the leader of Benjamin, otherwise the Likud Homes will pay a heavy price, and already pay! - To imprison any Arab leader in Hebron and of course any suspect immediately for interrogations, without visits of course, and if possible without meat and wine. Until the children are released at least. - Constantly attack Gaza and eliminate all Hamas leaders every day! Highly effective spot elimination, but every day! - Free Area C first from the Arab occupation, and prevent Arabs from entering the Temple Mount until the children are released. - Immediately repeal all Oslo agreements that are revoked, which the Oslo criminals will be prosecuted for. And they are already starting to pay ... - A power outage, water and fuel for evil in Gaza, Ramallah and all the territories occupied by the Arab terrorists invading in 48. - Give free permits for construction in the US, and increase the pace! And if you do so, you will succeed! Because this is exactly the policy of the Creator of the world, and this time Benjamin, the people will not forgive you for further subservience. """,1

"It has long been said that ""there are judges in Jerusalem,"" it also turns out - of course - that ""there is a president in Jerusalem."" Mr. President, you are an example and role model for the children of Israel and the enlightened world. Thanks ! And for those who did not understand, there is no connection (at least at the conceptual level) between what the Honorable President raised to his political views, but that superficial people, unfortunately, ""understood"" it differently. One way or another, there were human beings, Jews and Arabs, and always remember that life is short, let us take advantage of the best of them and become our home, our families with mutual respect and love for others. The heart aches for the Bible Some of the reactions mixed with a restrained racist tone ...",0
"Mr. President, knock on the table and tell them enough to abandon the citizens of Israel. Do politics instead of security. It is your job to make a sound and stop this horseshoe that Israel has been successfully under missile attack for a month.",0
How difficult and inconceivable,0
Raf Tasma We honor the Bedouin in Saudi Arabia. Aphtham?,1

Hundreds of children were killed by Hamas because it turned them into human shields and others dared to accuse us of murder,1
How many racists are there in Israel !!! Fear ...,0
Pleasant to read such things,0
Words like spurs ..... Bibi should be afraid of you. His conduct is so far removed from yours .... The Bibiurs case requires urgent care. Lindenstrauss claims that the Bibours case is much heavier than the first case. Expecting cleanliness in the governmental culture in Israel - this is the greatest danger to our existence.,0
"Until the wishes, one could identify. But with best wishes you crossed the line.",1
Lots of congratulations and a happy selection,0

Not in favor of the wedding but definitely agree with the dear president,0
It is her choice and therefore should be respected,0
Good luck and I have a feeling you will be a wonderful president ...,0
"""An integral part of the Israeli experience"" ?! What is the ""Israeli experience""? Something like a ""shopping experience"" or a ""service experience""? Are you the president of a country or a supermarket? Please tell me you meant ""being"" and your assistants did not accidentally recognize the auto-correction.",1
Honorable President - how sad and true and I wish peace love consideration and understanding will reside in our country and in our home. Good luck to you all,0
Well done to the President,0

"How good it is to see reactions that give hope for a better situation, as you mentioned Shavit and I will give you an example: I have a relative who married a Jew about 40 years ago, today they have grandchildren and they are in love and in life did not raise their hand and they celebrate the holidays of Jews and Muslims together and respect Each other and both still support the family, domestic violence and homicides and rapes and thefts are in all sectors. It is possible that the Jaffa couple will have a great life and it can be the other way around, but the most important thing is that I wish them and all the couples only eternal love.",0
"Mr. President, what do you think about the incitement and riots that took place in the Arab villages in the north? Why does not all of you sound there? The Jewish people sobered up in Operation Eitan Cliff ... we found out who our real enemies are from ...",1
"What it belongs to the right or the left is the opinion of the Honorable President, he did not educate the girl and certainly he is not responsible for her choice. Wake up and think before you respond.",0

"I would love to know a little more about the omission of funds, the economic Sabbath as you call it. While in the country 1.8 million poor people are counted and others who are not counted (on second thought none of them are counted are mostly transparent), is there a chance to omit their debts and give them an economic dome to recover as the land renews itself?",1
In 2001 I was in Afula I did not feel well in the middle of driving The policeman was an Israeli Arab The paramedic was an Israeli Arab in an ambulance and the doctor at the Valley Hospital was an Israeli Arab I do not remember any of them talking to me about Hamas or not treating me.,1

"I went to an American football game yesterday, just amazing the difference people stand in line and enter the game calmly (about 50.00 people), before the game the announcer reads and asks (does not require) the audience to cooperate with ""respecting the rules of ethics of the fans"", do not hear curses (there are Lots of kids around) and even when someone from the opposing team commits an offense in the game - do not quarrel! Just a wish, one day in Israel, I am full of hope nowadays",0
"Monday - so His Majesty will start keeping Shabbat together with the failing trio Boogie, Benny and Benjamin? Excellent!",1
"I will give them ?? !! Who am I to tell someone to marry a Jew or another religion! But it will happen in future generations! A few decades ago, Ashkenazis and Sephardim were forbidden to marry, just as today Arabs are forbidden to marry Jews, with generations everything will disappear and everyone will marry everyone.",1
"A group of Hamas militants defeated the so-called strongest army '' !!! So what did we have ??? 50 days of intense fighting in Gaza. The IDF was given freedom of action and did not supply the goods - the political echelon did not act in a deliberate, only trailing strategy. Residents of the Gaza Strip rightly fled because they were not provided with basic security. Enormous economic damage that will be felt in the budgets of the coming years. Moral harm to soldiers and civilians. Dozens of bereaved and physically and emotionally damaged families. No progress was made in demilitarization. I am ashamed and feel angry and hurt at the result.",1

Obviously better!,0
"For all the religious, first of all, you have nothing to worry about, because according to the Jewish religion, the woman and the children will remain Jews. Beyond that every person is allowed to do with himself what he thinks. Those who intervene are simply bored and pursue power. I hope that love will win and they will be able to overcome the cultural gaps.",0

My heart aches ... may his memory be blessed,0
I am very happy about the newly elected president. Sure he would justify his choice.,0
"I am very disappointed with your position. ""Incitement"" is not the main issue but the shocking phenomenon of assimilation, which destroys the house of Israel and constitutes a betrayal of the family, the people and its God. Your response lacks a value-based and moral approach to intermarriage and the need to do everything and prevent them. Addressing incitement and ignoring assimilation is inciting the issue in a negligible direction and turning a blind eye to the issue. """,1
"Reuven Rivlin When I saw you at your inauguration of the President I was proud to talk about you being connected to your Jewish roots and one of the greatest you are a descendant of his family and I thought things change that we finally have leaders who understand the value of Judaism because we endured 3000 years in exile and stayed with one and not democracy Understand that democracy is not a supreme value and politics is not something worth selling the whole past you came from. I am not religious but I can understand that being a Jew is a right and a responsibility and it seems to me that you are a bit confused. Yes, you may be president of Israel but not the Jews The little one",1

"Finally, there is a leader in Israel who acts as a leader.",0
"I'm really ashamed that my president writes such a thing. You connected strongly to the values ??of Christianity and in the process forgot the values ??of Judaism. You forgot why we are in the Land of Israel. To quote Z. Botinsky as if these are the reporters the Jewish people are following is simply a shame! Why do you not quote from our sacred teachings? Could it be that you are afraid to face the truth ?! This is not how a president of the people of Israel should behave. I'm really disappointed! To this day I have appreciated you, but it turns out that the presidency is really big on you. You are no longer who you used to be.",1
You disappointed us when you supported assimilation. Make an answer!,1
"Congratulations to you, you moved me endlessly. You can teach everyone what love is. My parents and I want to send you this greeting, but there are many pages of Robbie Rivlin. The Knesset website no longer has Mr. Rivlin's email details, so it was not possible to send the greeting by email. Hope it gets to you.",0

Hello President. This morning I met my abducted parents at the Azrieli Center and expressed support for them and told them that the people of Israel are with you and I am with you and something special that I received from them a yellow bracelet written Shuvu Ahim and I wrote them a letter of support,2
Good luck to you our dear president and of course to your wife who stands by your side and gives a shoulder to succeed in any position and position that you have wished you success and longevity,0
"Your Honor, unfortunately, it seems that the words you used have no place in this case. This is not racism but nationalism - for the short-sighted and limited of times it seems that this is just a wedding between a loving couple ... but for those who live for the eternity of Israel and identity preservation it is not just a marriage .. Every Jewish person living among us today remains a Jew since about 3,600 years Passing by, generation after generation his ancestors took care to preserve the Jewish continuum, 3,600 years of marriage within the people or with converts, of preserving the heritage and tradition despite repeated attempts by different peoples (some of which became extinct themselves) to exterminate this wonderful people, 3,600 years, another generation A generation that was cut off in an instant ... Comparing the pain of the people to racism could instantly turn into a double-edged sword and retouch the Israeli tradition. The concept of racism is not part of the Israeli tradition that accepts and uplifts the Hagar - many descendants of Gerim serve as cornerstones in the Israel tradition - Rabbi Meir, Rabbi Akiva, King David ... - Honorable President, I believe that out of pain and fear that racism grows among the people you wrote what you wrote .. you have nothing to worry about the honor of the president, the people are not racist .. he is national!",1
I have not heard of any Arab who married a Jew ... I wonder why? (Because on her wedding day she and he will be slaughtered),1
"To the President of the people of Israel who was elected with the blessing of welcome, and with the blessing of the leaf and success in your ways because the blessing of Gd fell on the entire Jewish people in your entry to this high position, who will give and your servants will unite the people who were so divided and hated each other since your predecessors served Honorable President.",0
"Honorable President Robbie Rivlin, I prayed for your election to the presidency and I was very happy when you were elected. You are not worthy to serve as President of the Chosen People. A humble, humble, Zionist and loving person. Wishing you much success.",0
It is not acceptable for me that a Jewish Sabbath will assimilate with a Muslim so its honor,1
"Lol ... and you believe in terrorist Arabs ...... you heard what a hudna is ... do you know that Muslims are allowed to lie when it helps them ..... did you forget to whom the Mufti committed to the Nazis and Hitler ..? Not to say it was and is not now ..... Abu Mazen is responsible for the murder of Munich ..... This is also forgiven ... shame hahahaha ... the truth is what hurts, that in the country there is no shame anymore ... every Poltkai is a subversive against the state And against the Jews .... to be ashamed when something is believed by many murderers ... Abu Mazen ... Abu Zero ............ Abu nothing.",1
"Stop trying to please everyone. You make me vomit in your beautifying behavior. Elected as the representative of the right. All your predecessors in office, who were elected as representatives of the left, were not afraid to bring their position to the position. You are suddenly trying to be overly stately and try to please everyone. Do not worry, whatever you do in the eyes of the left side of the political map will always remain a primitive representative of the right.",1
A red line passes through Rivlin? You crossed the red line yourself.,1
Your Honor The President All the seemingly racist chants are as a result of the actions and behavior of the Arabs and especially the Israeli Arabs who identify with the enemy. This is what I call self-defense and not racism.,1
Your voice is important and good to be heard clearly. Now we need to convince the prime minister to start addressing the pervasive hatred that is destroying what has been built here,0
Congratulations and at a good time I do not think there is anyone in the country who deserves this position more than you wish you lots of success,0
If it were possible to embrace him right now ... Blessing and success in the new way There is no more suitable than your honor Long live our bearer,0
"Friends, you talk to the president of your country, how do you ridicule and ridicule how long will we treat each other with disrespect? Do you just need wars to behave with such love for each other why not try to be more tolerant and I got more sea to different opinions of your mind stopped with it just got tired and more to the president ??????",0

Incitement You say you have traitors and terrorists in the Knesset How can the Arab Knesset members go to Qatar which supports and gives funding to Hamas and also where the traitor Azmi Beshara sits who blessed after spying for Hezbollah how can they go there they are traitors in the country they must not return here when you wake up. And by the way I would like to see a Jew who calms down (not to happen) an Arab and wants to marry her if they do not slaughter her themselves,1
Because of a handful of fools and extremists we are simply forced to bury ourselves in shame and disgrace Is it possible that in a democracy in the twenty-first century they will decide for me who will be my spouse? Does it seem to you? Where are the police and why does a court approve of a demonstration at all?,0

"Honorable President, if you can not express your opinion publicly against assimilation, for one reason or another, then I think it is better not to express your opinion at all on issues related to assimilation. Fulfilled, if you were interviewed and had no choice but to spread on your own initiative a post that has no word against assimilation, but only words for freedom, it is problematic and a pity! I'm convinced that Begin, who was a gentleman no less than you, would have behaved differently.",1

There is no revelation of incitement and I see a duty of Jews to enlighten the eyes of a Jew who was captured and lost a soul from the tree of Israel if Mahmoud really loved her ?? He would not force her to convert to Islam before the wedding.,1

"The Rivlin family. The great and famous grandfather is Rabbi Hillel of Shklov, a student of the Gaon from Vilna and the author of the important book 'Kol Hator' which deals a lot with redemption according to the teachings of the Ga'a. He immigrated to Israel more than 200 years ago according to the command of the Ga'a and with him a large group of students of the Ga'a whom he led. The Rivlin family, the family trees show the family's roots until at least the year 1670, and is attributed at least until the deportation from Spain. The family immigrated to Eretz Israel after the reading of the Gaon from Vilna (GRA), led by the well-known Rabbi Hillel Rivlin More in the name of Rabbi Hillel of Shklov, author of the book Kol HaTor. Rabbi Hillel of Shklov was the living spirit in the Hazon Zion movement, which was established following the commandments of the Ga'a, a movement that called for Kibbutz Galuyot and the building of the land. The first members of the family immigrated in 1806.",0

In Parashat Va'atchanan it is written: And you will not marry them - your daughter will not give to his son and his daughter will not give to your son """". Apparently Jabotinsky is above God in your perception. It is important to say this: we are the chosen people and it is not racism it is a fact! It is very sad that people like you are turning writers into saints. """,1

I wonder who writes him all this is a pity I understand that you are the president of everyone but you will address the biggest problem of the Jewish people today and it is intermarriage! Not to a dumb one or not that she did not know and did not know her religion and went and Islamized and pity every Jewish soul that goes to us! The President of the State of Israel refers to the demonstrations of what is happening to us,1

What are we completely crazy about ??? We must not succumb to dictates! We must not pay them salaries! Pay salaries to those who killed 64 fighters and call for our destruction? You do not know how to protect our important interests - return the keys and we will go to the polls. Thank God you have an alternative !!!!! It is better that these negotiations will explode and bomb Gaza from the air for another 30 days but this time we will bomb a moth to beg and not give up !!! Remember that the blood of the fighters is not shed for nothing !!!!!!!!!! Do not shame them and their memory. Do not raise your head to the other terrorist organizations in the area and show them that we are weak on the battlefield and in negotiations. Where is the Israeli deterrence? At this rate Arab armies and terrorist organizations We will be declared war again. Not for negotiations that weaken and demean us!

"Hello friends. I call on you today to come and take each and every small step, but together we will create a big wave, for you, for us, for the nature of the country and the future of the country in which we live. A step against violence, racism, coercion, chauvinism, well-being and diversion. And especially mainly against the denial of freedom of choice, the denial of personal liberty, the denial of the right to freedom of religion, worship and conscience. Rights enacted at the foundation of the establishment of the state in the Declaration of Independence. And above all these against the denial of the most basic and primary right given to each and every one of us as human beings - the right to love. And want to deny it to us. For those who did not hear and did not know: http://www.globes.co.il/news/article.aspx?did=1000963602 There is an inciting, violent, racist, and illegal organization that came today to destroy and destroy a wedding in Israel, just because in their dark and dark eyes an event It is forbidden to exist and must be destroyed solely because the groom is Muslim and the bride is Jewish. I repeat - solely because the groom is Muslim and the bride is Jewish. This is nothing more than that. A couple, a man and a woman who have fallen in love and want to get married and start a family, while the forces of darkness want power, violence, brutality, racism and dark fanaticism to sword and prevent this event. Only because the groom is Muslim and the bride is Jewish. Think about it for a moment - deprive them of the natural human right given to them to fall in love and start a family. Only because the groom is Muslim and the bride is Jewish. And think about it again for a moment - it sounds bad even from dark and dark days and bars in the boyhood days. And this is here with us, in the State of Israel, in the 21st century. Friends, friends and friends, I am sure that if you have heard and read you are shocked, angry and irritated like me, from this violent phenomenon, and such an event is going to take place tonight and take place among us. It does not matter if you are left or right, religious or secular, urban or rural, we do not want it in a state of freedom like ours, that will try to force on us violently, grossly, predatory and brutally violate our basic freedoms, one of which is the right to love and start a family . I know those who come to the sword are a minority, a handful of instigators, who only make a big noise. But we need today to say enough, enough, to show the voice of the sane majority, not just to be shocked and angry, these to take action. Each and every one of us in a small step and together a big wave. I call on all of us to come and demonstrate today against the forces of darkness that will try to destroy the marriage against, coercion and racism. This is to show that in our country, where we work, where we laugh, where we bring our child, where we pay taxes, where we serve in the army, who fight for it and even die, where we dream our dreams, where we plan our future - freedom and suffrage , The right to choose and love and start a family is ours. We will gather quietly near the event that will take place today - at 19:30 in the Red Sun Hall, 1 Altalena Street, Rishon Lezion. To strengthen and demonstrate against. Thank you for distributing this post and reading it to all your friends and sharing as much as possible.",1

"Unfortunately, I really do not believe Abbas, in my eyes he is just like Arafat was - saying what should be said to the world what the world wants him to say - solidarity and so-called understanding, without meaning half a word that comes out of his mouth, and in front of his people says otherwise - and encourages the kidnappers. Friendly advice from me to Abbas - let him stop talking and prove himself in deeds !!!! We are all for peace - we grew up with songs of peace, we were educated for peace and we pray for peace - unfortunately little ones teach the other side to hate Israel and encourage acts of injustice. The cartoons and videos that run on the Internet from the Palestinian street testify very well to the real public opinion - even of Abbas himself !!!",1

"Lol Dear President .. For years, players like Salim Toema Radi Biram Kiel and other such and other Arabs have been playing in the national team. So far we have not reached the World Cup. Maybe we'll change the equation? Maybe without Arabs we will go to the World Cup?",1
You made a big mistake in your statements you came out as a buffer against religion and the creator of the world. There is a Creator for the world and there are laws and halakhah and you will not change it because you want to be democratic and modern (slope). Apparently the presidency has crossed your mind.,1
"Shame on you for supporting assimilation, what future does the Jewish state have with a president like you",1
Too bad you can't dislike.,1
Shabbat Shalom Mr. President,0
Despite their courage we are hurting and embracing,0
"Three years ago we took to the streets. Across the country, that's true. But it has also happened all over the world. Young and old alike, protested about rising housing prices, rising food prices, carts, titillations, corruption and a host of other issues and mountains of fate. But our struggle did not bear fruit. Since we got a little older, we have become sober. Today we can say that all these problems are just a side effect of a much bigger and more powerful thing that we did not think at all to challenge. I hope you are sitting while you read these words. The real problem that leads to all these failures is democracy. We are not here against democracy, but we are against the use made of this word to describe the State of Israel today. We oppose most of the democracies that exist today in the world that operate according to the system of relative representation. 120 representatives control over a population of 8,000,000 people is an impossible reality. The fact that in order to be a Member of the Knesset (not to mention a Member of Congress in the United States) you have to be a rich person to fund a campaign is a failure. The temptation that even good people who are in this system have to succumb to corruption and make one hand with business entities is extreme. The time has come, in an age where technology allows it, for mass democracy. For a democracy in which any citizen who wants to participate in the democratic decision-making process will be able to do so. When only 120 people make decisions about millions it is only a matter of time before the whole system becomes corrupt and makes life costly for all of us. It's time to put an end to 20th century democracies, and start writing a new chapter in history: the mass democracies of the 21st century. Israel, the start-up nation, is best suited to be a pioneer in the world. Join us, and read our analyzes. *** If this sounds extreme / anarchist to you, and you want to tag us, remember that even in France before the French Revolution it would have seemed delusional for the people to rule the country and not the king! https://www.facebook.com/pages/ Democratic-masses / 406929672776167",0
I wish you good luck dear president! It is fun to hear that the representation of the country is a person who is clean-handed and full of compassion!,0
Congratulations your modesty has won,0
"The whole country is dealing with this zero this season named Mahran Rady. Instead of opening your eyes and seeing how the Arabs of Israel behave like a fifth corps and wait for the moment when they can put a knife deep in our hearts. Honorable President, you do not represent us, we have one people and one state and we must not trust the Arabs who are happy with the death of every IDF soldier, so please stop calling people who throw the truth inside as extremists, the truth is not extreme, these are a disillusionment of the people of Israel. You have been given a job that in fact does not really exist, so please deal with things that are more important than this zero, such as the tunnels in the south and north of the country.",1
"Mr. President, I am proud that you are the President of the State of Israel and respond to these manifestations of racism. I am a fan of Maccabi Tel Aviv and these phenomena against Rady are shameful and harm the club and the rope.",0
Shabbat Shalom to you and your family. You are a dear man.,0
"Free Hate - From the beit midrash of the leftists see what response I got when I wrote that ""In the Land of Israel it is forbidden to wave the Israeli flag !!!! it does not fit the left"" ""• They gave the animals a flag. I: A clearly illegal instruction !!!! The Israeli flag is sacred! People gave their lives for this flag! • People gave their lives for the Third Reich, so what? • We gave the monkeys a flag so that they would have something to fight about. • The disgrace of the family of monkeys and lemurs, a flag they need, bananas give them, peanuts give them, but a flag, why does a monkey need a flag other than a quarrel? Alas, the work is liberating. • Degenerates are backed one by one. • A flag he wants to wave, Nazism you brought us together with your stinking flag, through your fault I will not stand again waving the Kahanist flag, deaf people conquered the cliffs and the Holy Ark was captured. We have the blue and white flag for your devil's work • You have defiled the rag and the stick underneath it • The colors of the rag you hold in your hand are less important From your deeds damned Jews. I: Quote """" Injury to the honor of the state flag or emblem. Whoever violates the honor of the national flag or the emblem of the state emblem, or causes harm to his honor, or uses it in a way that could harm his honor, is liable to imprisonment for up to one year or a fine of up to three hundred pounds or two penalties alike. """" Tell me my friend if this reaction Is not hate free? """,1
"We should not let the children of the south and their families return until the IDF had ensured long-term peace and no ""dripping"" of mortars. Let's not go on with this mistake.",0
"Not to support racism is a minimum necessary to expect a president of a country that claims to be democratic. Now, how did it happen that Arab citizens receive such treatment? Maybe you should check, for example, Mr. Rivlin, all the racial laws passed by the previous Knesset that you were its chairman. This is not a head-scratching of extremism, the racist fish stinks from the head. Oh and, the Arab citizens of Israel are just citizens, who are supposed to be equal, they are not a set Exotic ""for the Israeli experience"" "". """,1
Totally agrees what right does anyone have to oppose a mixed marriage after all it is unparalleled racism!,0

"Mr. President, the one who calls the IDF soldiers murderers and the one who waves the PLO flags and the one who shouts in the streets of Israel ""Allah oh Akbar and Arbat"" ""refers to the beginning of the end of Zionism is the one who throws stones at cars and endangers their passengers. Only those who are law-abiding and all the rest will live with our rights.

Hear well good people of donkeys and it is not I who invented this name on the sons of Ishmael it is Abraham our father who said to Ishmael his son where you are here with the donkey with the parable of the donkey. Look around at what is being done with Islam and you will understand the difference between a holy and a profane one and between holy Judaism and Islam the unclean devil religion you will see how Islam has in it only evil only murder only killing only dictatorship and bloodshed one hates the other and kills the other. The people of Israel are as holy as the vine that is used to make wine. They do not get a hitchhiking with any kind of tree. Then nothing will help you because all the children born from this matchmaking are Jews for everything and the father and mother sat in hell until these children return to Judaism here in Israel. The holy souls of the people of Israel can be mixed with the unclean souls of all the nations. God and the Holy Goddess give birth to the souls of Israel to the world while the devil named Samal (ethics of Islam) and his wife named Lilith (night and darkness of the world) give birth to the souls of the Gentiles in the world.,1
"Peace to all the people of Israel. Be strong and courageous . This is the examination of faith and in His providence in the name of the Blessed One. We must be strong in the faith in the name and be united and support the families of the abductees. This is an examination of the compassionate Jewish people and behaves nobly precisely in difficult moments. In these moments we must not provoke cataracts in the sky by various accusations and divisions.Also, link the problem to a particular sector and not treat as a member of our family. This is a national disaster - when one of our sons was abducted. It takes us back to dark times, when Jewish blood was no man's land, when Jews were abducted in order to achieve their criminal purpose. The nations of the world will never understand our problems and what obedience we live and what challenges we face every moment, and only thanks to the merciful, terrible and great Holy Blessed is He, a sheep among the 70 wolves, the faithful shepherd who keeps his flock, we have hope to be saved. We are a strong people, there was not, and never will be, a strong people like Israel. Adherence to the name, behavior according to its dimensions is proof that the people of Israel are the chosen people - with the name. With regard to the hostages, I believe that the Israeli government is doing everything in its power to bring our sons home and also the security of its citizens. One request to the decision-makers: Remember the sage's statement: He who pities the cruel - ends up being cruel to the merciful. We must not succumb to pressure and blackmail and act calmly in order to achieve our goal. All necessary steps must be taken to bring them home. This phenomenon must be eradicated once or for all. When they (the enemies) hear - a Jew - they will tremble with fear and their soul will blossom at that moment. Offer to the terrorists who abducted the boys that the State of Israel pardons those operations and will not harm them if they release the boys healthy and intact within a limited time, and this will be considered a stupid and unacceptable experience and act on their part. Otherwise, it must be stated that in 24 hours, 50 terrorists detained with us will be killed at random, and so on until the last terrorist in prison. Restrict to stop all Palestinian leadership and cut off electricity, water, cause mass migration to these animals. This is a declaration of war. Rabbis !!! To mobilize the people !!! You are the true leaders who will soon lead to guide the people according to the word of God! In three days all the people must mobilize for this task: if the government is unable to respond, the people must stand up and do so as one man with one heart. Destroy Amalek. With the help of the name we will win. Hear O Israel, the Lord our God the Lord is One . To multiply in prayers that all the terrible things and calamities will depart from the world.",0

"It seems to you, Mr. New President, that for the positions of managers in the economy / senior officers in the army / judges, etc., there are admissions committees that filter out candidates, while for the office of president there is the most burdensome, lowest and loudest ""take let"" market - as we have seen today and in recent days? Is it proper? The taste is respectable enough? I wish you success, wholeheartedly, but in the same breath I ask his honor to consider changes in the way of appointment (not to mention this unnecessary and budget-consuming job ..).",0

Even the President of the State of Israel refers to this wedding ??? Has the world gone crazy ??? This wedding is clearly not interesting! Every day Jewish girls fall into the trap of Arab Muslims all over the country! The coverage is unnecessary and the reference excites the matter and causes unrest! Let her do what she wants! Dumb is definitely dumb !!!,1
It's time..congratulations!,0
"Honorable President, not related to Torah and mitzvos .. Understand these girls are being beaten by lesser sex and prisoners, everyone in the world has this pure right to choose whom to love. And with that I agree with you, the thing is that there will be a worrying phenomenon !! Search YouTube and you will understand what it is all about. Take advantage of these girls from start to finish. Understand neither I nor you are there for the girls (the ones who soon become mothers) after blowing their faces with power cables .. but voluntary organizations like Yad Laachim, they are there and probably their picture is fuller than ours - after treating several thousand women who experienced it This awful.",1

Honorable President I have not yet seen a Muslim girl go out with a Jewish guy and stay alive. And I would not wish on anyone to go out with an Arab. This is a dangerous trend that is gnawing at the world of the Jewish spirit and should not be given a hand and certainly not welcomed by the presidency.,1

To demonstrate is not incitement and it is the duty of each and every one of the Jewish people to maintain it and not to mix with the Gentiles Mr. Ruby Rivlin with some others like you will be here Holocaust should learn from what was in Europe and zealously preserve our identity what was no problem for Mahmoud to do It's only a matter of time until she cries for what she's doing and you and you should be ashamed to encourage such a thing at all or wish them happiness what do you think she will really be happy ?! On your conscience this encouragement !!!,1
Of blessed memory,0
Long live the President of the State of Israel !!!,0
Honest power is the main thing to be healthy and strong,0

Proud that you are the President of the State,0
Ruby Rivlin President of the State - you who constantly protect the rights of the Arabs in the State of Israel - Do you think it makes sense for a woman to be arrested in the State of Israel for every crime she waved the flag of the State of Israel? If she had waved the enemy flag the PLO flag a police belt would have defended her right there is no more sovereign state that would have a civilian detainee whose every crime is waving the flag of that country the state of which you are president and you have lost your trust in your country in its symbols and identity.

I think that over-intervention in the couple's wedding reinforces the phenomenon of assimilation because it is the most publicized wedding in the world.,1

The spiritual level of the daughters of Israel is several times above every spiritual level of every woman in the world and especially of the Ishmaelites.

To demonstrate is not incitement and it is the duty of each and every one of the Jewish people to maintain it and not to mix with the Gentiles Mr. Ruby Rivlin with some others like you will be here Holocaust should learn from what was in Europe and zealously preserve our identity what was no problem for Mahmoud to do It's only a matter of time until she cries for what she's doing and you and you should be ashamed to encourage such a thing at all or wish them happiness what do you think she will really be happy ?! On your conscience this encouragement !!!,1

Tragerman was killed by our Arab enemies under the auspices of the Ishmael government that Gd would pay them badly for the relief you give the Arabs and for the 100% restraint you show toward them. May his memory be blessed and rest in heaven alongside the righteous of Israel.,1
Shabbat Shalom Honorable President.,0
Congratulations and at a good time to you and all the people of Israel. I was happy .,0
"Letters of love / strong desire for your husband to be president, should not come up in my peace this morning ... does not seem appropriate to me",0
Exemplary. This voice is so important and so lacking. You prove it is possible to be national and enlightened. The belligerent and horrific reactions show how important it is for the leadership that considers itself national to take responsibility and set the boundaries.,0
Watch him be like a prize. Too bad the job will take you left..good luck,1
Translate into English and we can distribute,0
Mr. Ruby Rivlin .. I did not expect to hear such things from you ... Do not become a shaman of all the rubbish of Shimon Peres ... As a former Betar chairman you should support the right and not the bastard Muslims .. Say what you say an Arab can not marry Jewish point!,1
"Good luck, our President ??",0
"It is not appropriate for Mr. Rivlin to serve as president at this time, so the masses of Beit Yisrael think like me along with most of the Knesset members who are the electorate. I believe that tomorrow, Monday, the news of the election of President Rivlin will resonate throughout the country and the world.",0
Love you Ruby !!!,0
"Honorable President, there is democracy and there is the assimilation of the Jewish people, and that is what needs to be allowed to happen. But it has to be done convincingly and tributarily. And not by threats.",1
"Honorable President, how do you give a stage to an Arab MK who speaks against Jews?",1
How sad the name will avenge the blood of an artist,0
"Love you Ruby,,, you were great and will stay great for us,,, Big Lake,,,",0
For all the quarrelsome people who have no employment other than sitting on a keyboard and voicing their stupid opinions. Where is the problem with marrying an Arab and especially that the bride will convert to Islam. Where ??? Stop pushing your nose at what you have no control over and especially the love that blossoms between an Arab and a Jew. those who jealous shall live and suffer .,0
Lovely!,0
"After winning the presidential election, it's time to roll up your sleeves and cut the House of the President's hallucinatory annual budget, which jumped to 60 million in seven years. (From 20 million)",0

Well done to the President,0

You are adorable ! We literally won the president!,0
good luck in your new job,0
"I wish everyone would have thought like you, Mr. President, maybe then we would have lived in a more normal reality.",0
"Honorable President Rivlin, as President of the State of Israel, you must pay close attention to when it comes to a matter concerning the four mothers of man, which is between him and his God, and when the matter concerns the whole of Israel and how we would like Israeli society to look. The Torah has already said: ""The hidden from God our God and revealed to us and our sons forever"" "". Secretly, that man will do what he thinks and believes and the account is private between him and God,"" but in public ?! The enormous responsibility lies with you to make sure the educational message of the leadership The public turns to the right building of the nation.In the public space the questions to be asked are: Why do we want to educate our children and what is the value-worthy message to the State of Israel.How did you get it wrong ?! The assimilation of our sons and daughters is a sick evil that your fathers sat on seven? We lived throughout the exile to prevent the assimilation of Israel, the holy people, among the Gentiles in which we lived. And it was difficult! Culturally and emotionally we were surrounded by Gentiles. The tension was great, sometimes out of affection and sometimes out of hatred, were the weakest of the nation assimilated among the Gentiles. Want to convey to the youth?! What is the message to the daughters of Israel ?! In the name of freedom blurs the identity you are talking about You give legitimacy to the daughters of Israel to marry Gentiles ?! If you do not understand that you are a symbol for the nation what is the right vision and how to act and think, then you are not worthy to sit in office This is Shimon Peres , That I am far from his perceptions East and West, knew the importance of the institution of the presidency, and used its status to represent the State of Israel in the name of its values. He did not care about individual freedom as much as you care! He condemned any behavior of a ""private"" Jew who expressed or acted in public in a manner that did not conform to his worldview! And rightly so. This is the institution of the presidency. You have been elected president in the name of your worldview. The people of Israel believe that you represent better than those who oppose you the way the State of Israel should be seen at the public level. Why when a person with the most adapted values ??to Judaism arrives, folds his worldview, and hides it in the name of so-called individual freedom ?! What, then, is the point of electing a president ?! The people of Israel expect more from you, our esteemed president. """,1
Blah blah blah . How many brain confusions can you read in 11 lines ?? !!,1

"Mr. President, what about all the distracting leftists and Arabs who turn away to murder and harm Jews all the time and the police do not use the same force and power only against children and women in evacuating Jewish communities?

"A perfect evening, Honorable President ...",0
"You're talking about the president, give honor, you idiot. And he did not support assimilation ya stupid",1
"The dubious Jabotinsky citrus makes you Mr. Rivlin, talk nonsense. No one wishes for his death or, God forbid, an ordinary Arab. The problem is simply in the marriage of assimilation, that it is simply forbidden from the Torah. Point. And no justification will help. It has nothing to do with coexistence. I supported your choice, you are usually a decent person, but when the Jabotinsky citrus comes to mind, the results are disastrous. In any case he will be successful as president, and will strive to write more sensible and wise things.",1

"Honorable President, what do you have for this week's Torah portion after you have consecrated an assimilation marriage this week ... It seems that you are immersed and the creep in your hand ... It seems to me that the name is blessed Open with you in a private weekly Torah portion ... to remind you of the thirteen principles of form. Grace and peace ... and take you the role of the confused Yuval and Hershel Shlomiel in your liver and training the creep of assimilation ... My heart is with you ... If only you would be silent ...

Shlomiel like you",1

Citizens should be measured by their actions and their degree of loyalty is not necessarily coherent in their origin or religion.,1
I would expect the president of the only Jewish state in the world to send a sharp and clear over-message against the marriage of a mixture of assimilation and conversion. Assimilation is a surrender to Eichmann.,1
It is not acceptable for me that a Jewish Sabbath will assimilate with a Muslim so its honor,1

Shoshi Slutsky - You will be ashamed to void the memory of an innocent child with a burning of hatred.,1

Of blessed memory,0
I have a dream of having a Jewish president. I have a dream that there will be at least one Jewish state or one state that will not undermine Judaism. Not bad . We will wait for you to finish your term. So dreams may come true. Lapel to morale.,1

"A group of Hamas militants defeated the so-called strongest army '' !!! So what did we have ??? 50 days of intense fighting in Gaza. The IDF was given freedom of action and did not supply the goods - the political echelon did not act in a deliberate, only trailing strategy. Residents of the Gaza Strip rightly fled because they were not provided with basic security. Enormous economic damage that will be felt in the budgets of the coming years. Moral harm to soldiers and civilians. Dozens of bereaved and physically and emotionally damaged families. No progress was made in demilitarization. I am ashamed and feel angry and hurt at the result.",1
"You do not represent me, President in disguise you have sold your soul.",1
I also do not understand the father where was she 5 years she is in a relationship with him ?????? Now you're crying !!!!!!.,1

"It's really not pretty all the wishes you wish him here! First of all I believe that his daughters / granddaughters have received a more appropriate education and therefore will not marry someone not from religion. Second thing the girl made a decision and nothing will change her! So enough to think that you can control the world and change the decisions of others, go invest your efforts in better things, instead of wasting time on it. The consequences she will have to deal with later, for better or worse, and that time will tell. So enough! Deal with your own affairs.",0
Shabbat Shalom makeup artist,0
Of blessed memory . God will raise up his blood and we will be privileged to exterminate the seed of Amalek.,1
There will finally be a president here who understands football.,0
At this time it hurts me and hurts me to death that the President of the State of Israel does not understand the pain of a generation of Jews who do not forget what held our people as the glue of the Torah of Moses Ruby. Is this what you are transmitting to us? Instead you will comfort the parents and it is time to offer a sack to everyone who demands instead of quoting expressions of Zabotinsky who would surely protest the context of his writings on this subject Is this the new spirit blowing in the President's house ?? Is protesting the assimilation of the people a violation of democracy? Are we protesting the enemies of peace and democracy? What did you not understand Ruby? You have given us some hope but also you trampled on it with a handshake If you have some respect turn your place to your good neighbor Yahweh give courage to his people let Yahweh bless his people with peace,1
There is no need for you ... I wish you great success,0
You are not charming !!!,0

It's so sad !!!!! Blessed be the memory of this sweet child,0
"I understood everything only one thing did not. Why every time someone expresses concern towards the other in this case it is the concern for morale (which to me personally is not interesting) it becomes incitement ??? Where is the incitement? This is the way people believe. We can live with them in peace to witness business with them and eat with them but getting married is already unnecessary !!! It seems that if a Jew had taken an Arab to marry her, she would have been murdered by her family. So enough for the actresses and say incitement incitement. There is no incitement here only mutual guarantee and concern other than the other. Anyone who tries to present this in a different light is beautifying themselves !! And it's a ruby ??that you chose to buy the left-wing and Arab sectors precisely from the height of your position, while you keep the right-wing away.",1
"But the religious Muslim groom that in the moment he will spare no means to torture his wife! Both by rape and beatings! Morlosh, pity your soul if you do not spare your body! Do not put yourself in a situation where you will have to flee to a home for battered women!",1
Well done !!! and congratulations,0
In a democratic state where a priest can not marry a divorced woman ... what can the state do to their freedom?,0
May your hope come true!,0
"In my opinion, we need to think about the idea that there will be no more kidnappings ... just as there is a chip for a dog, we need to make a chip for humans ... so that no matter what we know where they are !!! It is imperative to bring this idea into the Knesset and promote it. With the help of the name the sons will return to their families and continue to pray to the Father in heaven",0
Love is above all only when we understand and are respected the change will happen here. Congratulations to the young couple. Love is the whole story,0

I did not choose you ... but warm congratulations and good luck Mr. President,0
"I am against incitement and racism It is a pity that they do not start with Gideon Levy Hanin Zoabi Ahmad Tibi, they set a good example of racism that the police will stop, so maybe the racists on the other side will be afraid",1
"Honorable President of the State of Israel ... I am proud of you for being elected. There is no person worthy of you to be president. You are clean-handed, straight to the poor. Wishing you lots of success in the job <3",0
Congratulations to the President and his wife,0
"Honorable President, I warmly suggest you read the belligerent, violent, racist reactions and be shocked! Part of Israeli society is sick with a disease which it is doubtful has a cure, a rotten society and a lost society. Congratulations on the brave words and on behalf of the citizens of Israel, I am ashamed of the disgust that some of the respondents wrote for your publication.",1
"There are things that need to be seen with the national eye while examining meanings for generations. (Like pity for the families of foreign workers, ""not to expel them."" ""We all feel sorry for them. What do we have no heart for?) Mr. President, you better not refer at all. If it comes close to being a norm, from"" ""Jewish Democratic"" ""in the end will remain only democratic ""A state for all the peoples.

Hi ... Honorable President Reuven Rivlin All the people from fire to old are praying for the peace of our three abducted sons. It should be aggravated with the security prisoners who are forbidden in the Israeli prison to immediately stop their studies and physical fitness the food as of hotels I ask you Mr. President any terrorist or kidnapper a Jew or Druze his parents and his whole family will be expelled from the country so he will do,1
"Danniel Qeletti. You are more than welcome to move to Gaza, you are oppressing Israel ... you are beautifying yourself ... how do you even compare our children to children and terrorist families. They want to murder you too! Yes, you will be surprised ... so while you choose to side with the opposition, you will live there ... you are betraying the country and you are like a B'Tselem organization ... revoking citizenship and exile you ...",1

"This is how it should have been done in Beitar, where this phenomenon is much greater",0
"You have honestly earned my liking, sir, President of the State of Israel!",0
"Epic, personal opinions are nice. In a country whose citizens are Jews, Christians and Muslims, the president of the state must be the president of the whole state and not just of the Jews - sometimes even contrary to his personal opinion. It's the price of democracy and your ability to write whatever you want ... a man of his faith. Shabbat Shalom",0
I am also very right-wing and think that every person's decisions should be respected .. but it is good that there is this protest and demonstration that the Jewish girls or young girls will understand the problem here .. if they save one Jewish woman it is worth everything!,1
You are the King of Shabbat Shalom,0
"Indeed, I understand your position, Mr. President. On the other hand I do not quite understand the necessity of the family to state their opinion. Publish the topic in all media. Indeed the state is a Jewish state and we were educated on values. I definitely wish them good luck if indeed they have chosen the right path. On that occasion you will be allowed to ask to convey a greeting to Eliezer Manny.",1
In the beginning he created a-God (and you write as if you care not to write the name of God) and all this in the name of Z / Botinsky ??? !!! What happened to Genesis that God created the heavens and the earth that Moses wrote from the mouth of the hero?,1

"Shame and disgrace to the State of Israel! Soldiers are killed in Gaza, the whole country under rockets, Morel's father with tears in his eyes begs his daughter to return to him and to the waiting of the people of Israel and President Rubin Rivlin, greets Morel and Mahmoud: ""I wish the new couple health, peace and joy"". I wish you the opposite because you are not a Jew and you are not a democrat! You hate Israel! """,1

"In honor of our esteemed President. I was looking for a president. A president who will marry me and not himself, a president who speaks to me and not me, in him. And here in your first speech a sentence that requires study was said. Observation. ""I stand before you in true humility. Of a Jerusalemite."" ""And what is special about a Jerusalemite who has more special humility than Ashdodi Ramatgani or Holoni? That a Jerusalemite is honored in his city and not his city is honored. Jerusalemite feels the inhabitants of previous generations, kings and sages, the dream of generations, Jerusalem's vision , To the mountain that dwells in his heart, waiting for the owner of the house to come. To the vision of the connection of Jerusalem, a city connected to it, the vision of Jerusalem's perfection. And filled with humility and humility. He feels not only the different voices of the divided people, but their desire reflected in his city. May your pure desires be fulfilled, for us and for Jerusalem. I am happy and honored with you and know that you carry in your heart, and from your heart to the whole world, the inwardness of our hearts.",0

"I am outraged at ""your approval"" and your heartfelt wishes for the ""lovely couple"", we escaped from the assimilation of the Diaspora and here we are getting it here in our country due to despicable politicians' mistakes! I wonder if you would have reacted if it was your son or your home! Menachem Begin and Ze'ev Jabotinsky Peace would certainly not agree to this assimilation and even some of its opponents, since there is no Jewish blood involved in foreign blood !!! Moreover, these leaders called on the people of Israel to be united among themselves and not to invade beyond that !!!! revolt and weep over your words, esteemed president! """,1
Yes praying to the Creator of the world it helps and it is tested.,0
Sir may you have a Shabbat Shalom.,0
"Mr. Rivlin who noticed, how she became a healer of the soul, straight you blame the Jews, what she wrote, an Arab actor will not be humiliated, the Jews did not mention that the Jews are always humiliated in their country too, they must not raise their heads, some Jews are murdered by Arabs, you heard about the girl Shelly Dadon who murdered her Arab drove a taxi, just because she is Jewish, heard about maybe the three boys who were killed because they were Jews, and because you and a policewoman prevented the death penalty for terrorists wanted to release their terrorist brothers in prison, today two returning students murdered by a Palestinian Arab, one was run over Of the tractor in Jerusalem, and the other in the Jerusalem forest, but with you Mr. Rivlin, Shimon's twin, racism is only with the Jews, no wonder Mr. Netanyahu did not want you for the job, how everyone replaces your skin like a chameleon, only you come to power, including your teacher Begin , Destroying the city of Yamit, and the land of our ancestors Sinai gave to the murderer of Sadat and entangled us in a terrible war in Lebanon, and gave the High Court to Aaron Barak, the Ashpist, there is a verse in the Torah that says your destroyer and your haters came out of you.",1
Congratulations dear and truly deserving man because you are a special and humble man and hope to attend the ceremony,0
You will learn from a prize that was unifying among all and not agitating like you. Our late sages said sage to wisdom silence,1

Why Bibi H :-) :-) Does not soothe the powerful winds of hatred.,0
Judaism and Democracy Two parallel lines that can not meet - Judaism puts God at the center of God who gave the Torah and made a covenant with the people of Israel - read the current Torah passages - how much Moses warns not to betray the commandments of the Torah - otherwise we can not live here,0

Good week to the President of the State What fun to pronounce these words You have no idea how much pride there is in success !!!!!!,0
Everything is dwarfed when a 4-year-old child is buried,0
Your tenure as president begins with repulsive hypocrisy. Condemns racism at Maccabi and goes to Teddy to kiss the members of La Familia.,1
Congratulations to the President of the State of Israel. Shame and disgrace that there are citizens who swear and pour poison on our social fabric that also includes the Arabs of Israel,0
Congratulations to our new President rose and succeeded,0

Align force,0
Participate in your grief and hurt your pain very much !!,0
"Honorable President, since that moment yesterday when I heard about the tragic death of Daniel Tregerman my soul knows no rest. I also saw your great pain as you comforted his parents. I just wrote my words to you as a post on the Prime Minister's page. I asked and thanked in advance if you would discuss my proposal together. Subconsciously, the name ""Operation Jonathan"" came to my mind at that moment, ""which commemorated the name of my prime minister's brother, a name on which many generations grew up and was educated. I thought that instead of the name"" Eitan Cliff ""(although a name full of meaning but seemed to be automatically removed From some drawer of a government copywriter) it would be appropriate to change the name of the operation to ""Operation Daniel"" (of course with the consent of his parents and family). I am sure that all the people who are hurting like me will unite around the name and thus preserve this sweet, angelic child. Forget who fought and sacrificed their lives for more than 60 other angels, it is also possible that his name and beautiful figure will serve as a guiding light and inspiration for you, our leaders, to do everything, in this historic moment, to reach a comprehensive settlement with the Palestinian people. ""His life in an ugly war of adults, just as right as it is. Thank you very much for listening and good luck in your job.""",0
"You deserve all the respect our dear president. Despite and despite the war situation, you went out to accompany the late Daniel Tregerman to rest forever. While members of the government did not come ...",0
Rivlin Just do not forget for a moment where you came from successfully and with great respect,0
"To all those who whine about Rady and take care of him. I run a boys' soccer team at the age of 15, which team? Betar Raj. The team includes children from all political backgrounds and fans of various teams (especially Beitar Yam, Maccabi and Hapoel Tel Aviv). At the height of the rush with the crowd we turned to Rady to come to the club, talk to the kids about coexistence and also a bit about football and the difficulties he went through. I'm back again, 15 year old kids !!!! (The connection was made through one of the coaches in the department who is a Maccabi Tel Aviv fan). And what did the acclaimed actor choose to do? Instead of being an example to the children, instead of being a bridge of coexistence, instead of answering the curses in the actions of education and advocacy, instead of taking care of the education of children from a young age? He chose not to come, probably curses from the stands are better than a picture of his visit to a Betar club. An act that he probably would not have forgiven his close friends. 15-year-old children !!! Disagree with the curses but apparently won them honestly",1
Gd taught the people of Israel through Moses that a Jew is not allowed to marry another member of another people. How can you as a Jew not be ashamed to bring in G-d as if he supports it? disappointment .,1

"Unfortunately, we also have weeds. Agrees with the President that there is no room for violence. There is room to express an opinion but legally and unobtrusively. Her right to do so. This is her life and it is true that there is an enemy plot to take our daughters but it is her choice to fall into the trap. We can only warn her ...",1
"Sad no words, may his memory be blessed!",0
I have to correct some common mistake everywhere on the subject of marrying an Arab ... and people emphasize the issue she will be a slave. You will be beaten. That's not the issue at all. Because good or bad husbands are not related to religion or nationality it is found in all sectors. We are here discussing Islamization. About going over the Torah of Moses. About marrying a gentile. To marry if a person who is not of the seed of Jacob our father. Her child will be called Muhammad Mahmoud What a Jewish mother can call her son instead of Avraham Yitzchak Yaakov Moshe Aharon Mahmoud Mahmoud Come eat and it is important to add that all these relations between Arabs and Jews are also read because of the joint schools that study together,1
"Friends, we are not Hamas. We will moderate the reactions. Some culture and control fortified. Fans of the mezuzah weapons, read what is written in the Torah about the Hagar who lives in our country. The army is doing its job successfully and we will become human beings worthy of this glorious army.",0

My dear president let me call you Ruby please come up and the success has made order in the house because no one is able to know and recognize your wonderful love for the Land of Israel and especially for Jerusalem I am sure and trust that a person like you can try to connect our people and clear many weeds growing here. I wish you much success in whatever you do thank you,0

"What we are undecided to say, the Torah writes in 3 words - ""and it will not succeed"". There are powerful trends and muscles predestined to failure. They belong to the family of illegal immigrants on the mountain. Is it really possible to establish a Jewish reality, a state with present and future, This question is addressed to us, the people who believe in God and Moses worked and secretly hope that the political echelons will begin to make 'brave decisions', crush Hamas and stop making us internationally ashamed. Here is a tested virtue for returning to sanity: Draw for yourself from time to time, at That you are returning from the synagogue on Saturday night, preparing in awe for Kiddush and the meal, and when the little boy sends an accidental finger to the power switch, 'Shabbat!' Jumps in panic, well at that time the people who will restore our security and make strategic decisions for Zion's redemption. Meat with yellow cheese and accumulating prohibitions on routine excision. Right education? Yes, of course. They are all captive babies and therefore our attitude towards them should be like preterm infants in the incubator: lots of compassion, lots of prayers. And drums no !! Does the role of the Jewish Agency not include, among other things, preventing assimilation in the Diaspora? So what will they say now if here in the Land of Israel they dare to have a wedding whose whole essence is assimilation, and more in public? Until you come to preach to us about assimilation you will see what is happening in your country, will be the answer. After all, an Arab is not allowed to marry a Jew and that means she has converted to Islam or should convert to Islam. If it was your daughter you would talk like that. Shame disgraced to a person who sees himself as traditional. You are probably really dedicated - T. Saws from Judaism everything that is difficult for you to accept or maintain. """,1
"Good luck in the high and lofty role. You deserve him for your personality and your honest and humble way. Continue in this way and will present us in Israel and in the world with wisdom, determination and sensitivity!",0
"Mr. President, thank you for your inner honesty and humanistic approach.",0
"The democracy you mean contradicts Judaism which is our only excuse to hold on to this land !! Free from laws and mitzvos?!?!? So it is better to throw democracy into the sea, it is better to have a British mandate ..

Yours sincerely, do you really think that the parents of the children should already be found guilty?

Our elected president I so wanted you to choose and I was so happy that you are a decent honest man and a noble soul I am sure you will succeed in uniting our people and bring a lot of respect to our beloved country.

Hurts even more. A charming little angel. He will rest in peace on his bed. Heartfelt condolences to the grieving family !!!,0
I propose to let every settlement in Judea and Samaria establish three new neighborhoods in the name of the murdered. This is the answer to the lowly murderers everywhere we will win with Israel alive and well forever !!!,1
"Well done, good luck.",0
"Huppa, we have an enlightened president !! What has racism got to do with it? This is a war on assimilation. And I do not believe that you are really in favor of this move, but you should play it nice and show that you mean what you said in your inaugural speech and prove that you are the president of all citizens. So that's great - you really need to be president of all citizens. But that still does not mean support for assimilation. And I do not believe you would be happy if your daughter wanted to marry an Arab. To tell the truth, you have disappointed me!",0
"Mr. Avshalom, what do you care? It's her eyes !!!!!!!",2
Certainly most deserving. Ruby is the oldest generation of the beautiful Land of Israel ... Good luck,0
Lovely! well done . One of the people,0
"Good luck tomorrow, Honorable President",0
It is amazing how you encourage assimilation and do not worry about the existence of the Jewish people! I did not just claim that your election to the presidency would be a disaster - you are hypocritical and align with the extreme left !!!,1
I wish them other things. Let's go look for Arabs what they want from our Judaism from haha,1

Enough with the racism. This is the private life of the couple.,0
Well done,0
Dear men . And honest man of Jerusalem,0
Really ashamed what his connection is at all to this junk heap people would make sense,1
"Honorable President !! You're right and hope we win this day and do everything we can to say they are equal citizens. But before I want to hear Mahran condemns the crimes of Hamas and the PA. For this reason you are in no hurry to come out with bombastic headlines. Because you are not comfortable with the sector. Dear Ruby, that's what I called you at the Likud Center. Handsome requires handsome and fulfilling grips on their backs as well. Shabbat Shalom and Dash to all",1
I wonder how you would react with your daughter would you marry if Muhammad. In a dream at night you would talk like that,1

"Only in a country as racist as Israel. People will demonstrate in pure harassment, against the marriage of a couple who have known each other for 5 years. Assimilation? Beauty ! At a good time. Being a Jew today is shameful. Being Israeli is already a serious illness.",0
"As a Maccabi Tel Aviv fan, this racism should be thrown off the field, it is not appropriate, especially since he is a player of your team",1
Beautiful,0
"The President of the State of Israel - the State of the Jews, is very dear to us. I am sorry to have disappointed you with your intervention in the matter of assimilation contrary to Judaism and the Torah. As an individual, you were able to say what was in your heart, but in your lofty position you were misled by judgment and it is a pity ...",1

"May their memory be blessed. God will give Hamas the hand of Messiah son of David and roll them down like rocks !!! There is no doubt that they should be included, but the State of Israel has never entered Hamas, as the Americans or Europeans have entered someone to the end. They say they need an operation of one kind or another, but remember what I am saying here - only the Messianic King will make a mountain out of the bodies of Hamas!",1
I wish you good luck that you will represent only the people of Israel and not as beautiful and dreamy as your predecessor ... The people of Israel with a strong need a strong president with a Jewish tradition !!! lots of success,0

Also a vote against the removal of Hanin Zoabi. Then what do you want ?,1
I do not believe only now you signed twenty years after where you were so far the chances that in our past may no longer be used ....,1
If Zoabi and Tibi are allowed ... and they do so in an extremely provocative and illegal way !! So they are allowed too !!,1
Dear Mr. Rivlin .... there is a very significant difference between democracy and assimilation woe to us not just written with alone will dwell and Gentiles will not be considered ... I do not want to think how it would have ended if an Arab had decided to marry a Jew not sure it would have ended At the demonstration .....,1

"The dubious Jabotinsky citrus makes you Mr. Rivlin, talk nonsense. No one wishes for his death or, God forbid, an ordinary Arab. The problem is simply in the marriage of assimilation, that it is simply forbidden from the Torah. Point. And no justification will help. It has nothing to do with coexistence. I supported your choice, you are usually a decent person, but when the Jabotinsky citrus comes to mind, the results are disastrous. In any case he will be successful as president, and will strive to write more sensible and wise things.",1

Dear President Rivlin A - Keep in touch 7 years ago I came to President Peres' sukkah and brought him a printed letter with my request to follow in Ben - Gurion's footsteps and support Israeli democracy by changing the electoral system to a mixed system of half the Knesset in 60 areas! President Herzog also wanted to change the system! If you do something in that direction I will feel that you also successfully represent me Cohen Shmuel Jaffa,2

"Well done to the President who came to the funeral. I'm sure he had advisers who advised in light of the circumstances, and for security reasons, not to come. But as we know Robbie Ravlio I'm sure he insisted on coming. You showed nobility when you came to pay homage to a 4-year-old boy who was murdered in front of his house. It's just a pity that none of the sages saw fit to go your way.",0
What fun you are our president !!!!,0
"You made a serious mistake. I do not want to hear from you at the moment. How we did not understand Bibi. You always want to be the sea even when it's Jewish. Hello from Jerusalem, the capital of Israel",1

Lovely,0
All this would not have happened if the generalization had not advertised the wedding invitation dozens of Jewish bananas marrying an Arab or a Christian no one bothered them. This bride loves advertising problems so there are some bees it seems to me that even Muhammad will suffer from it she will know how to make a mess for Muslims too because for me it is not love this girl is a source of problems. That the Arabs will take this into account,1
Just a note: actors are role models so their opinions do matter.,1
In this case it is clear to everyone that the smell is the stink,1

Democracy will further overthrow the State of Israel !!! Why is it forbidden to hunt animals? Why is it forbidden to raise an eagle at home? Why is it forbidden to go through the red democracy !!!!!! Why is Christianity forbidden to spread in the country ??? democracy !!! The freedom of poop! This is what you will begin to learn and understand that we are walking according to the divine democracy,1

"There is a good chance that such a marriage will end in failure, a good chance that if it was Rivlin's granddaughter he would have done everything to prevent it from happening, and yet, in a democracy their right to marry. Whether the public likes it or not. To work for assimilation is great, but to demonstrate with the aim of ruining the wedding of a mixed couple who have been dating for five years is ridiculous and its whole purpose is to provoke a cheap provocation by the Lahav organization. The incitement that is calling for a demonstration in order to preserve the Jewish people is a real disregard for intelligence, I find it hard to believe that all those demonstrators really think that the fact that they will make noise there and make a fuss will make the girl run away from the canopy and recalculate the route.",0
"Dear and beloved Ruby, I know you love your people true love. But in this case you must not take such political statements to show as a person who seeks peace and equality for all the peoples and religions in the country. Because tomorrow your granddaughter or niece may have a Muslim with you in the living room. So please listen to the truth and not to this shallow and despicable populism",1
"The mother divorced and went out with an Arab, and the daughter converted to Islam and the mother is also on her way to convert to Islam. Mahmoud you would not agree your sister would marry a Jew to the mother of the married also you would not agree your daughter would marry a Jew and if that happened your sister would marry a Jew it would probably be her end .... Morel is already Muslim what does it matter marrying an Arab. Morality go and atone for your and your mother for all the Jewish people. Morale and Your Mother Historical Background Forced Jews to convert to Christianity, or to convert to Islam. Who did not agree to convert to religion were executed and were willing to sacrifice themselves to the ax just not to convert to religion. The story of Hannah and her seven sons Background The decrees of destruction Antiochus Epiphanes decreed that Hannah to convert to the religion she did not agree sacrificed the seven sons and herself to the ax just not to convert to religion!",1
More pure forever,1
Now that all the garbage leftists and the whole right have left all 7 million Jews and will simply overthrow this shitty government that does not worry about us neither in security nor in livelihoods nor in apartments now is the time to hit the roads to block all of Israel from Eilat to Tel Aviv just overthrow our shitty government,1

Ruby deserves you and it was also felt the will of the people with great success and so on. There will be honest politicians like you. It is no longer possible to hear about all the corruption from the former prime minister to the former president to the former finance minister and in addition to all this also the corruption in the mayors and regional councils. How possible it is anyway you are the number one proud Israeli citizen and a kind Israeli.,0
Too bad you were disappointed !! I thought you were right !! Turns out I was wrong !! Disgust that you are in favor of assimilating and more with Arabs !! Ichx,1

"From what I understood, if the mother is Jewish, then the children are Jewish. .. ???? So what are you jumping for, do what you want, what are you jumping for ... other than a healthy mise is not a good marriage between siblings ... that's why Jews and Arabs do not get married",1

"Well, the reactions just ruin me - and a gentile Germany who fell in love with a Jew in 1934 - what did they tell her? Be ashamed. What do you think makes Jews better than Muslims? Stupid nonsense. The character of human beings is personal and not dependent on religion. All human beings are similar to each other in emotions and the basic mechanism of life, difference is purely cultural and fun to get to know other cultures and mix peoples. This is all the beauty in the current era when the whole world is accessible and small. ""Assimilation"" is a Nazi concept!",0
"Mr. President ... you may not support assimilation. As I said in a previous post - I have nothing against the bride and groom (do not know them at all), but it is not possible that out of the 8 million citizens of the country she could not find one Jewish guy available for the wedding.",1

Hear well good people of donkeys and it is not I who invented this name on the sons of Ishmael it is Abraham our father who said to Ishmael his son where you are here with the donkey with the parable of the donkey. Look around at what is being done with Islam and you will understand the difference between a holy and a profane one and between holy Judaism and Islam the unclean devil religion you will see how Islam has in it only evil only murder only killing only dictatorship and bloodshed one hates the other and kills the other. The people of Israel are as holy as the vine that is used to make wine. They do not get a hitchhiking with any kind of tree. Then nothing will help you because all the children born from this matchmaking are Jews for everything and the father and mother sat in hell until these children return to Judaism here in Israel. The holy souls of the people of Israel can be mixed with the unclean souls of all the nations. God and the Holy Goddess give birth to the souls of Israel to the world while the devil named Samal (ethics of Islam) and his wife named Lilith (night and darkness of the world) give birth to the souls of the Gentiles in the world.,1
A humble and special person. Shabbat Shalom .,0
"Well done, Your Honor!",0
You are the president of our dream country and this is your dream ?? Not Peace ? Not the kingdom of David? Not the Temple Mount? Simply delusional but probably appropriate nowadays ...,1
Congratulations to my dear Ruby.,0
"Artist and Honorable Artist The President of the State of Israel with Israel who honestly earned you. Good luck, and may we have a blessed Shabbat Shabbat R.H. with good news and the abductees will soon return to their families healthy and whole Amen and Amen !!!",0
If the people had elected a president I am sure you would have won 99.9% of the people's votes. But unfortunately our corrupt elected officials are the ones who elect the president but I am sure even they will make the right choice. Good luck and big and already in the first round.,0
Oh this Arab actor was proud of a country that gives him what no other Arab country in the world would give him then okay. But I have never heard from such an actor that they are proud to be a part of this country,1
Good luck to you Honorable President I believe in you!,0
He will rest on his bed in peace.,0
Long live the President of the State of Israel,0
You will learn from a prize that was unifying among all and not agitating like you. Our late sages said sage to wisdom silence,1
Ruby will be the president of a record ...,0
"Wow, exciting consolation, great success with the help of the name, tomorrow Ruby for the presidency of Israel, artist and artist.",0
"Successfully ! The Honorable President-elect, Mr. Reuven Rivlin, hopes that in your lofty role you will unite the people from all walks of life for peace, brotherhood and evil.",0
Heartbreaking . There is no such pain. May the memory of the magical Daniel be blessed.,0
I do not understand what the story of people here. It's her life to do what she wants! You live in a democratic state for God's sake! I also think she's making a mistake but it's her opinion and her * full * right to hold that opinion. Regarding the intervention of the President - I am glad that in our country there is a President who stands by democracy and freedom of expression.,0
Well done ! Looking forward to hearing condemnations from the Prime Minister as well!,0
Disappointment,1
"Rivlin Did you start your term on the left foot ?! No problem with your daughter marrying Hamsnik! But please do not force your disgusting opinion on the daughters of Israel just to please your Arab brothers, be ashamed of yourself ...",1
Dear President Ruby and you are now everyone's grandfather,0
"Mr. President, you, as the former president of Beit Yerushalayim, I am ashamed of you for saying these words .. Israel team for the people of Israel .. not for the Palestinians who represent the Israel team .. A team that has Arabs does not represent me or Beit Yerushalayim. Pure house forever !!",1
Congratulations to the President of the State of Israel. The President of Kol-Lem,0
"Shabbat Shalom and congratulations to the President-elect. Amen, yes, there will be a wish !!!",0
Love you Ruby,0
"I wish everyone would have thought like you, Mr. President, maybe then we would have lived in a more normal reality.",0
Sad So sad Thank you for sharing and sensitivity,0
"You surprised me, Mr. President, and I'm glad you did.",0
"I was very happy that you were elected, but you took all the air out of me and the desire to support you when you repeat Peres' mistakes and express an opinion on an issue that is not worthy. Israel does not like to see assimilation and as our president",1
Good luck from the bottom of my heart,0
"You have forgotten from above your place a very important detail the mutual guarantee that every Jew owes to another is a moral duty embedded and ingrained in us with Israel that surpasses all the hollow slogans you have started since you took office to quote with the exaltation of democracy in your throat about freedom of expression and incitement. Indeed I see that you take a stand when it comes to justifying your words as the worst of our enemies from the extreme left do and you use the same linguistic techniques of the enlightened beauties of darkness that oppress the Israelites who cut the branch on which they sit while fed by the worst enemies and enemies of the free world. Among the people for greed money (their name will be erased) note in all the comments in this post who are the most praiseworthy your words will enter the wall of one of them sample and you will slowly understand that you are marked as someone who can spread the Islamization propaganda of the region and the world later. It all starts small until the devil takes over and spreads in your personal consciousness and is spread through your role and status to your entire sphere of influence .. Robbie Rivlin Through you I learned an important lesson that in every declared right-wing extremist leftist hides God will save you and your shoulders. I express my deep sorrow at the fact that I supported in every way that was called in my way even symbolic in your election as president and express that your soul from the way you as an undercover left made your way to the top through the hearts of the people of Israel and the whole Israel will be will and if you are as described in my response. And he will bring you back in complete repentance before him and give you in your heart the understanding to understand and enlighten your deeds and severity in the eyes of God and man. I write my words in pain and anxiety about the fate of the people sitting in Zion, because if a flame fell on the cedars, what will the mosses of the wall (the most famous wall of all) say?",1
Congratulations to your grandson who photographed you like this especially and also to you for agreeing to straighten up !!!,0
Right. Strongly opposes and hurts this marriage. But it is her choice and she will bear the consequences. Leaving them demonstrations will not help. Only education and information because unfortunately there are and will be more such cases.,0
Well done ... a tremendous dream I dream with you and hope that the dream will come true ...... Shabbat Shalom and wonderful .......,0
"Yossi - he did not encourage assimilation. A careful reading of what he wrote makes it clear that he is against and so his views have always been clear. This president does not have to prove to anyone his closeness to religion. He simply pointed out that even if it happens (unfortunately for all of us and I wish Dalla) then it is forbidden to trample and abuse the people who do it. To me, it is aimed at preserving human dignity and not at assimilation.",1
"Well done ! This is what I expect from the President of the State of Israel! But where is the Prime Minister ??? Oh right, the same people choose so he must lick the mob ....",0
shame,1
"Once upon a time there was a chief of staff in Israel named Raphael, one night he stood in front of us before going into action and said, ""All the Arabs should be taken to be loaded on trucks and transported across the Jordan. Raful told him there are also good evenings, he thought for a second and then answered them women in the cab of the truck. ""The main conclusion from his remarks was that Arabs should not be trusted because they only want our elimination. a point to consider",1
Ruby You are the next President of the State of Israel Shabbat Shalom,0
"A dedicated fighter ready to kill and kill for his country - as described, by the Channel 1 documentary department, ""State"" (!!) a Palestinian terrorist, in the caption of the documentary film ""In the Eye of the Storm"", which was rebroadcast tonight. Only in our sick and crumbling country, supporting the enemy is a legal and legitimate act that no one will protest against. This is another Palestinian propaganda film, which the state broadcasting authority has chosen to adopt, which features, among others, Rami Elhanan, a distorted extreme leftist, whose daughter was killed in a terrorist attack. During the film, he claims to one of the participants that """" the killer is also a victim """" !! Imagine that someone would claim that Yigal Amir is also a victim ... and this distortion reflects aloud, what causes a Palestinian terrorist so much hatred that he is willing to blow himself up. Rami Elhanan does not want to know that all over the Muslim world, dozens of Muslim lunatics have been exploding in recent years, regardless of the ""occupation"". Rami Elchanan expresses his morbid hatred of the right when he asks his son if he does not know that they are not allowed to wear orange at home? http://www.iba.org.il/ibadoc/Teuda.aspx?entity=1009460&type=1 """,1
Honorable President,0
"No one incites, just want to hold a mass demonstration in front of the hall, what's the problem?",1
There is nothing like true grandparents in Hod,0
"Terrible and terrible this terrible disaster !!! The conduct of the Honorable Presidents, the current, the Honorable President Rivlin, as well as his predecessor, the Honorable Former President, Mr. Peres, is admirable !!! Let them be healthy, I am proud of them !!! That they will no longer need to come to painful and terrible events like this. Amen !!!",0

Congratulations to the new president after eating poor weed in recent weeks now we know who the big donkeys came out ...,0
"One woman, a resident of Zarit (a town close to the border in the north), said in Dan Shilon's program that she had heard for a long time that they were digging under the house. When she reported this, they sent her and the rest of the northerners who hear drilling and excavations mostly at night to take sedative pills. She described how she sees in Lebanese territory concrete trucks and heavy construction equipment go under greenhouses and do not see anything built above ground. She tells how her whole house is shaking, objects are moving and falling .. This is just one community among the many residents of the northern border who have been hearing the sounds of excavations for years! I personally heard many testimonies from IDF soldiers who served on the northern border, who heard excavations, reported to their commanders and nothing was done. They were released long ago! What we had with Hamas in Gaza is nothing compared to what awaits us in the north with Hezbollah. People of Israel, wake up! The residents of the north are alone with this threat. Hamas is the son and student of Hezbollah when it comes to methods of warfare and tunnel theory ... The tunnels in the north are much larger and more dangerous. What happens to us? Fear of conflict? Close your eyes ?? If it's quiet there, what's not clear? They are just digging .. The Israeli government is immediately asked to act to protect the northern settlements and locate the tunnels there as well and get out of a working assumption that the tunnels are already below the northern settlements. The lives of the northern residents cannot be abandoned. If they bring these tunnels into motorcycles and vehicles And everywhere in the country. This is a first-class strategic threat to the security of Israeli citizens. The attack must be prevented from the tunnels that can be carried out every day. Their religion without any delay. We must not allow the failure of the Gaza Tunnels to repeat itself and allow them to carry out their plan for Rosh Hashanah, God forbid. I will expand on what has been said, even though the dripping of Hamas launches into the Gaza Strip is to draw our attention to Gaza. Be distracted and not be free to engage in the real threat in the North. This is an ancient tactic of shoplifters who come in pairs. One asks the saleswoman full of questions and the other steals unhindered .. I scared you? I'm scared too! Let's all work together .. there is something to do .. what can be done? **************** * Share this status and it is advisable to add a few words personally from you, it will make your friends pay attention and read what it is much more than a simple sharing * upload more viral statuses of your own. Note that the image is crucial in the chance of the status to catch the surfer's eye and go viral. * If you have photographic evidence of anything, (how the furniture shakes or moves, photography of suspicious excavation sites, your photographic evidence ...) flood the social networks (Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, etc.). * If you want anonymously, write me your testimony in chat and I will put it below the comments to this status. (Anonymously of course). We must not take the issue off the agenda and we must demand a reference from our government. On such an issue the power of each of us may be limited, but we are all together with a tremendous power to bring about a change in priorities. We, the masses, have the power to bring such an issue to the forefront and no longer allow our government to bury its head in the sand. Here is a documentary that aired on Channel 10 five years ago. Momi Bitton, a resident of a northern settlement who heard excavations. Channel 10 brought an acoustics engineer there. He unequivocally checked and determined that they were digging underground. With machines. That was five years ago !! Watch the video. Three minutes. http://news.nana10.co.il/Article/?ArticleID=1072877 The mayor of Kiryat Shmona sent a letter to the defense minister in which he wrote ""From the beginning of the operation, I began to receive inquiries from residents living near the Lebanese border, who claim to hear underground noises.""

"Outgoing President Shimon Peres began his tenure as his wife Sonia. During his tenure, Peres divorced and was widowed towards the end. Whoever benefited from the fact that Peres was a single grandfather and celebrated seven years was Sarah Netanyahu all the time the wife of the prime minister who became the first lady in the country without a rival. Despite her tireless efforts against Bibi, Sarah was unable to prevent the election of MK Reuven Rivlin as the country's tenth president. Already in his debut speech in the Knesset, President Ruby announced to Sarah's dismay that his wife Nehama would henceforth be the first lady in the country. In the coming months, a frontal ""confrontation"" between Bibi and Ruby must be expected over the question of who will be the first lady in the actual country. """,0
"The omission of funds? In reviving Robbie, did you return to comedy? You laughed at the pacifiers, the oppressors of the public and the banks in Israel",1

Of blessed memory . His rest is heaven.,0
A Jew is not allowed to marry a Gentile! Point! What needs to be subdued and inventive combos? !,1
Success in the new position !,0
Really exciting.,0
"A president who revolts against racism and hatred is a leftist? What kind of nonsense? Robbie Rivlin has always been a liberal, even when he was Speaker of the Knesset, despite being a genius by birth. Congratulations to him! And for that I love him!",0

In a few months the Jew will start beating her ... and for every operation with the Palestinians killed she will be cursed and humiliated ... and when she gives birth to more Muhammad and Abdullah and Hussein ... the groom's mother To a disgraced slave ... It is a pity, Mr. President, that instead of looking statistically at the lives of Israelis who spent several years in a marriage prison with Arabs, and how great their patience is and how many are imprisoned because of the children in the middle. You chose to behave and express opinions that you would not stand if your house would bring you some groom Muhammad who lives in the village and gives birth to grandchildren ""Nasrallah Hussein Ahmad and Abu Khalil"". I ask you on behalf of all the sane in the country to return! Remember that you were elected President of Israel ""They are marrying our daughters ideologically to occupy us in the Ministry of the Interior ... Do not bury your head in the sand !!!""",1

Think poor Jew.,1
"Honorable President-elect! Stop being a country of suckers, poor people who do not know how to act alone and listen around ... Stop, you will already wake up! A government of tired people! Gather in them with all your might and just listen to others .. Act on your own .. Let us feel a little pride in this country .. Apart from the humiliation and insecurity nothing else feels in this country .. Why? Because someone said that a ceasefire was needed ... not because the State of Israel decided, but because someone else decided for it ... why? Because the poor Arabs .. and what are we not?!?!? You have to kill them, you just have to wipe them off the ground. Some people can be cruel to kidnap children, fucking children who have barely seen life !!! It's ages 16 and 19 ?! And abuse and kill them !!!! What made them poor why they deserve it !!!! The State of Israel will wake up there !!!! Dyey and enough to listen to others !! Act on your own !!!!!!!",1
"Rivlin home, deal with yourself and not with the Creator of the world who gave us the Torah. And it is written in black and white that Jews are not allowed to assimilate, we are not allowed to marry Gentiles. So please you are only flesh and blood and you should not intervene and try to influence the Jews. Go to a creative shrink. And do not lick to the left. They are merely human beings.",1
Shame and disgrace that the president gives the green light to assimilation and evokes sympathy for intermarriage It would have been better not to react at all,1

Dear Ruby how much I have been waiting for this class has made my day and the years a success,0
"Honorable President (by the way, for honor you have to work and we have not seen anything yet) The incitement in your words is not Jews against Arabs but against a reality where girls get married to convert to Islam and go through masks of torment and then beg to be saved unfortunately I have not met one who has not passed this mask. Their lives to rescue them so I ask why? What's good about it? And there is no answer other than complete blindness in the name of freedom of choice",1
"Mr. Ruby, I knew you when you came to the Kfar Saba Municipality, to apply for a license to publish before the election, you registered me, especially in your popularity, I wish you success, I am sure you will be a president who will unite the people, an excellent president, good luck",0
"Wishing you to be president, you are the most deserving of all the candidates traits rooted in you love of Israel",0
"Mr. President I am ashamed to read your post to encourage intermarriage and more at this time it is a certificate of poverty to the presidency which in my opinion is a waste of public money and unnecessary. I would expect that at least you will not respond to a sage to wisdom, silence and enough wisdom to imply that you did not start well disappointing !!!!!!!!",1
"How could she support assimilation? You are the president of the Jewish state who has given legitimacy to assimilation. Mr. President, there is nothing wise in saying that it is better to remain silent. I was the first among your supporters. You are no longer representing me. The people of Israel have lived and existed all these thousands of years in maintaining assimilation and you have brought the end near.",1

"Honorable President, I was happy about your election as our president, and I saw you as clean-handed and a supporter of Israel and its teachings. In the first week, publications about taking money and bribes were discovered, and my heart ached, it was decided not to discuss it, and I was relieved. Today, when you express support on a liberal and democratic basis, contrary to the Torah of Israel, to the tradition, which spoke well of your praise, your support for a mixed and assimilated state that may interrupt our Jewish rabbi in Israel and around the world, amazes me and unspeakable disgust. Hopefully here too thank you for being wrong, and thank and leave Yeruham. And please do not you turn the esteemed chair to a Jewish president! Haim, a Jew who cares",1

Sad at heart!,0
"Ruby Rivlin does not encourage assimilation !!! He is trying to show the way to a sane life in a law-abiding democratic state !!! Assimilation has always been ... the fact that 3,000 and something a year after Abraham some of his children with fair skin and some with dark skin is probably not just because Ethiopia has more sun than Russia ... and yet the people of Israel are alive and well ... Assimilation was a danger That we survived in the Diaspora and because of its so marginal percentage here within the State of Israel, it is clear that this is not what endangers us ... What is endangered is free hatred, incitement and racism ..",0

"Shame and disgrace, I am ashamed of you for your support as a Jew in assimilation and disgust.",1
"Well done to President Rivlin, a brave man",0
What a cute ! At the coronation he was really looking for Tzumi .. so now he got it.,0
"Dear President, you are ashamed of what you said. What would you do if your granddaughter, your daughter, chose to marry an Arab ?? Would you speak the same way?",1
"Lucky you're not my president. Indeed, there is no place for racist and shifting violence, but there is also no place in a Jewish state for a Jewish president who supports intermarriage that is forbidden by Torah.",1
Finally a serious president in this country,0
May his memory be blessed ... so sad,0
Every word carved in stone . You must not fold or justify in front of the fighters and racists. It is good that this voice is being heard in the midst of a wave of violence on the networks.,0
There is no doubt that you are the man who deserves to be the President of the State of Israel and I have no doubt that your wife who will live will represent our country with dignity and success.,0
Thanks . To the President. State. Israel. B,0
Dear man you are,0
She is simply betraying herself (the bride) in the family in her blood and especially in her land that thanks to this land and this land she has a roof over her head,1
"For one citizen, receive heartfelt greetings from a small citizen.",0
"Mr. President, close this establishment.",0
Congratulations to the President of the State of Israel.,0
How much sadness and pain: (A boy's charm! T.N.C.B.H.,0

Beautiful,0
Like you,0
"What incitement and what violence and what racism is the Honorable President talking about? Since when has a demonstration against assimilation been incitement and violence and racism? How unfortunate and how unsurprising that the ""right-wing"" president ""embraces the savage leftist incitement, which is being waged against this justified demonstration against intermarriage and assimilation. How unsurprising that we have not heard condemnations from the honorable president, for all the anti-Israel incitement spoken by far-left speakers.""",1
Shabbat Shalom and good luck,0
"Monday - Peace and blessings in honor of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu: The people of Israel continue to cry ... The left and Oslo criminals (Livni, Lapid, Peres, Barak, Aharonovich, Meretz, Yachimovich, the High Court ...) are seeking a response from the head And not from the belly. The truth that they are one hundred percent right. The reactions from the belly of these criminals with the morbid and deadly slogans that oppose all morality and human reason (restraint is power, peace is made with enemies, we must give them peace gestures to free terrorists ...) Crime, thousands of wounded to this day, thousands of Jews deported in transfer (left allowed), billions of dollars in defense spending, home protection, building walls, healing the sick and wounded, property damage, and released terrorists who continue to murder! And the people of Israel are waiting for the apology of Oslo criminals in vain ... It is definitely time to act from the head, so the people of Israel demand: - You must act from the head and declare convictions in Gaza, Ramallah and other territories occupied by these evil terrorists as enemy and hostile evil for everything, and act accordingly (no more electricity, water, fuel, .. .) And of course to collect billions of dollars of debt from these wicked ones first - you must act from the head and eliminate Hamas from the root includes the leadership, thoroughly thorough, to the last of the killers! Eliminate it means kill (no prisoners), and do not send our planes to destroy scooters, bicycles and empty houses! It is a spit in the face of the people of Israel and a disdain that will cost the Likud their homes dearly (like the release of the terrorists in the last miserable belly reaction)! And if you have to enter Gaza, then you enter Gaza using the Putin method. Give 24 hours for the evildoers to evacuate women and children to Egypt and then cannons and planes, for a week until the tanks enter to evacuate the rubble and scum. - You must act from the head and immediately enact a death penalty law for terrorists or aiding and abetting murder and take care to pass it! - You must act from the head and free the hands of our excellent soldiers from the laws and shackles of the far left organization of the High Court, which endangers them and all the people of Israel, as proven daily! - You must act from the head and liberate the Temple Mount, all areas first and build foam And East Jerusalem. This of course will lower the prices of apartments and bring employment to thousands! - You must act from the head and solemnly inform the Americans not to intervene in the defense of our country and our children, thank you. (They do it in Iraq, Syria, Libya, Egypt which are thousands of miles away from the borders of America, so let me do it inside our country). - You must act from the head and immediately solve Mr. Aharonovitch, Mr. Danino (directly responsible for the default and abduction of our sons) and of course all those responsible within the police and the Ministry of Internal Security. Not only will they not stay in office but consider prosecution for their direct responsibility! Benjamin . The people of Israel cried enough! It is time to act as the Israeli Prime Minister must act! And if you do, BH will succeed! Because this is exactly the policy of the Creator of the world who appointed you as Prime Minister of the people of Israel, as long as you are educated to do and act from the head, and who removed (at best) any prime minister before you (see your predecessors ...) who failed and surrendered To the wicked, and act from the belly and foreign and hostile interests! If it is difficult for you, open the Book of Kings, and the Book of Samuel in the Bible, and understand and learn how a leader with Israel (King David) must act from the head and behave with his enemies around and inside ...",0
"Gali I am neither right nor left, I am in favor of living together because there is no other option and it is difficult for people to recognize it and hatred will not bear fruit, we want all the innocent to live in peace and the bad people to disappear (unfortunately there are many).",0

"Honorable President-elect - Elected thanks to the great love of the public and Knesset members for you, and thanks to your hard work and honesty. Hard work awaits you of a united and divided Israel, and a respectable representation of the State of Israel in the peoples and in the Diaspora. Long live President-elect Reuven Rivlin.",0
Waiting for pictures of the proud grandson of his grandfather like all the people of Israel,0
"We have a president. On a painful issue as much as it is the values ??of democracy must be above. There is no room for free hatred and racism even if it is about difficult issues and sensitive periods. Respect for faith lies in its place but please do not be required to run the country that way. We will not wish for a state of halakhah and will not agree to one. Like many here, for me the situation may cause discomfort. But this is the challenge of being a free man in a democratic society. Not all Arabs are enemies. Remember, a person is not responsible for his origin he is responsible for his actions.",1

Very sad !! It's like a nightmare what will it be? ????? Of blessed memory,0
No more silent,1
"Honorable President, you are right, but when sitting in the Knesset of Israel like Hakim Zoabi and Tibi who are racism in its entirety, do not expect the simple citizen to restrain himself and not be a racist,",1

Honorable President. True a democratic state. But would you like your granddaughter to marry an Arab? Or vice versa? I wonder what will happen to her in just days from today. And I think it's you given a seal of approval in case you're forced to eat the hat under the auspices of democracy. And I suggest that you start practicing on canvas on your own from now on,1
There is no doubt that you are better than Bibi and Sarah in every field! Good luck to you Robbie,0

"Ahmad Tibi, a Palestinian Arab, a citizen of the State of Israel, praises terrorists for a clear violation of the Penal Code of Incitement to Terrorism, and he still roams freely and bullies and today abuses a Jewish and Zionist MK like Ayelet Shaked from the Jewish House and IDF soldiers and pilots and serves as a member of the House of Representatives. This is a shame and a disgrace to the State of Israel and its institutions and leaders, led by the Prime Minister, who allow such a person to do so and do not immediately deprive him of citizenship and throw him into Gaza and let him do whatever he pleases and incite? State of law we said? So where exactly is the law and enforcement ??? Beeps at the Israel Police and does not report for questioning. Disgrace.

Oh this Arab actor was proud of a country that gives him what no other Arab country in the world would give him then okay. But I have never heard from such an actor that they are proud to be a part of this country,1
It is a wonder in His honor that you are thus encouraging assimilation among the people,1
You are the grandfather of us all .. President Rivlin appreciates and loves you :-),0
"One president was massacred, another president was raped and another president was an Arab, and what country do they say that?",1

"Dear Robbie Rivlin. Why in any situation with the vile terrorists we come from a position of guilt seekers. We already want investigations that the police are guilty of. In my opinion there will be enough time to blame. First of all let the children come back healthy and intact. Secondly, why do the security captains not announce that all the Hamas leaders in the prisons have been put in a dungeon until the hostages return safe and sound without conditions of visits and contact with the outside world. To let them know that any kidnapping can only release inmates from the dungeon to jail.",2
"Well done to the President of the State, Walla knows how to write, I am proud of you",0
Robbie is the right man for the job I hope he manages to get elected and keep the embers of the honorable presidency. Good luck in the second round.,0
You are the most suitable person at the right time and in the right place and wish you great success in God and continue to be humble as only you know,0
"Writing an identification status is not enough. We need to share, share as much as possible, flood the media. If Eilan Golan led to a storm in the media, if the case of David Hanchalwai led to shares in all media networks and awareness of all the omissions regarding shooting orders. The world does not understand the reality we live in, it is true that hundreds die in Syria and starve to death in Africa thousands of people. The abduction of three innocent boys who have not even enlisted and their murder, it is already crossing a red line and breaking all conventions and human code. If we want change, we have to work for it. And it starts with throwing dear Hanin Zoabi out of the Knesset.",1

Ruby will be ashamed of you ..... Shame that you are the President of the State of Israel .... Stop beautifying yourself already ..,1
You have great respect for the doctrine of the people of Israel that God will soon punish you Amen only he will do justice here eat you out of this position and soon you do not need another president like Peres here a real Jewish president want here not fake like you will be ashamed you are president of Ishmael or Israel In assimilation for him the laws of the Blessed One and his feces are not considered here you have no God Ravlin,1

You have been given a job that in fact does not really exist, so please deal with things that are more important than this zero, such as the tunnels in the south and north of the country.",1

Soon doomsday, do not think there is a discount for the President of the State of Israel ...",1
Good luck Robbie. You have earned the job honestly.,0
This is called love successfully,0

"It would have been better if you had not referred to this crazy wedding ... the thing here is not racism nor hatred nor anything in style but with Israel the same people who survived the Diaspora all the serious disturbances and all the attempts to destroy us etc. etc. At last we arrived in our country and now instead of having a Holocaust with Thai Gases, etc. make us a silent holocaust a holocaust that no one notices a holocaust called ""assimilation"" ""and this holocaust Mr. President you can deny in words but it will not stop until we say enough!

"Dear Yossi, an astrologer ... you do not have to be a great astrologer to predict the choice. This was clear in the first place, despite the hurdle at the end of the process. Other than Grandpa, just because you're an astrologer does not mean that the president has time to mess with anyone who's trying to promote his business.",2

"The state's attitude towards them belittles both the security aspect and the economic aspect. Personal Information - There are still no clear guidelines regarding the payment of a July salary even to residents of the Gaza Strip who have been instructed to leave their homes. As the president of the state, you must deal with this - take the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Economy for a conversation and urge them to issue written and clear instructions to employers on how much and how much they should pay employees.",1
"Well, the reactions just ruin me - and a gentile Germany who fell in love with a Jew in 1934 - what did they tell her? Be ashamed. What do you think makes Jews better than Muslims? Stupid nonsense. The character of human beings is personal and not dependent on religion. All human beings are similar to each other in emotions and the basic mechanism of life, difference is purely cultural and fun to get to know other cultures and mix peoples. This is all the beauty in the current era when the whole world is accessible and small. ""Assimilation"" is a Nazi concept!",0

Ruby Rivlin President of the State - you who constantly protect the rights of the Arabs in the State of Israel - Do you think it makes sense for a woman to be arrested in the State of Israel for every crime she waved the flag of the State of Israel? If she had waved the enemy flag the PLO flag a police belt would have defended her right there is no more sovereign state that would have a civilian detainee whose every crime is waving the flag of that country the state of which you are president and you have lost your trust in your country in its symbols and identity.

In the 80s you would not say that,1
Shocking .. !! What else needs to happen for someone to sober up and uproot Hamas .. !! The Lord will avenge his blood .. !! Daniel Katanchik T.N.C.B.H.,0
President Clown is what you are ... a piece of love .. because of assimilation we will get a holocaust on your head ... just make sure to do some post that will get you some likes after they will destroy our ass because of this ... register that you are president ..,1
"Hypocrite,,,, chameleon,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, An expert on this week's Torah portion?",1

This is a president who will be healthy. Our Prime Minister and the great Mary Regev have risen and succeeded.,0
"Mr. President, I can not respect the assimilation of my people, the daughters of Israel to the people of Israel, if there was an Arab who marries a Jew they would cross, burn and stone them, enough to use the bullshit of the word democracy, the democracy we are so proud of shattered our country and our people to pieces , There is no tolerance and forbearance for assimilation, extreme left and traitors and you will have success in the job.",1
The fact that he is against incitement does not mean that he is a leftist .. enough to be a foolish rightist .. Ruby beauty!,0

"Ruby our beloved friend we are so happy that you have been elected to be the tenth president of our country. You are a Jerusalemite, the roots and salt of the land. There is no doubt that she will fulfill the presidential role with no common sense and wisdom. You are the man of the people and you will know how to unite him",0
"Sammy, you're so right! Why did Bibi become silent in the face of the horrors of violent racism? Is he afraid that the rage of ""this is the people"" will ""turn against him? That it will become clear that he has no power to control the raging madness?""",1
"Carl, in the context of your addition, on poverty in the country, I do not agree with the claim that in the State of Israel there is a high percentage of poverty distress. There is a lot of distortion and speculation in this matter",2
Ruby you are a dear and special Jew I wish you only success because you really deserve to be married to the capital of the Jewish people!,0
The president encourages assimilation with Islam with all due respect. Is it for being stately? To be the president of everyone? You will be president of the Arabs,1
"Whatever the noise they make, the whole Muslim has married a Muslim. For every wedding the Honorable President will respond?",1
"?? Once upon a time there was a rich contractor who finished building a tall building, he went through the whole building to see that everything was fine, when he finished his tour on the roof and wanted to go out he found that the roof was locked, he tried his best to open without success, the contractor stood Near the railing and started yelling at people to help him but no one heard, with no choice he opened his wallet, threw a hundred dollar bill and hoped someone would look where the bill came from, the bill fell past someone, put in his pocket and continued on his way without looking, the contractor takes out another bill and another The same thing people take, put in their pockets and continue on their way, when he finished all the bills in his wallet he took a small stone and threw it, the stone hit someone and he immediately raised his head and started shouting at the contractor ""Why are you throwing stones? ..."" Suddenly filled with longing for Egypt """" We remembered the fish that was eaten in Egypt for free """", everyone who reads this is amazed, how can it be that the people of Israel receive manna - bread from heaven that has all the flavors and they miss the fish that ate in Egypt for free? Tell us this, is it to condemn the people of Israel? But the Torah wants to let us see how much a person can sometimes To witness so many miracles and wonders and yet when something does not go exactly as he would like he will immediately start complaining, and in fact the Torah gives us a look of ourselves so we can notice how many times when we receive all the good God gives us it seems obvious and God forbid something Not going as we wanted we are immediately filled with complaints and grievances. Our ambition should be to look up to God when the ""hundred dollar"" falls on us and not when the stone falls and of course our right and duty to pray and ask for what is seen and revealed, there will be a desire that we have no reason to complain and we will have complete redemption very soon. Shabbat Shalom """,2
Shabbat Shalom to you our dear President was elected thanks to the fact that you are the most suitable of all the other candidates who have had a lot of success in health and a good life.,0

"Mr. President, look at the belligerent responses. The state has changed its face. Our shared dream will only come true when we finish the occupation. Long way .",0
"... and you'll be the president's wife, good luck",0
"With all the respect I have for the Israeli people who unite in times of war and help each other, I can not respect those of those who put their nose in matters not theirs, a Jewish woman who fell in love with an Arab man and wants to marry him is causing an almost national storm just because she fell in love with a person They sit comfortably in their heads because he was born from another nation that is not a member of the Jewish people, have mercy on them. What the hell is your business with whom she wants to marry, a Jew, an Arab, a monkey or a rooster? It is her free personal choice that stems from what her heart guides her, she does not force her personal choice on your life, and just wants to marry quietly and peacefully, so who are you to tell her if her heart fell in love with the right person or not? Our people must grow up quickly from this pathetic and prying childhood that grips them, in which they try to force their beliefs and opinions on the other if they do not sit in the exact same box in which they were raised. Unity in the people does not mean ""unity in the people"", otherwise Mr. Fate, unity in the people is to respect each other's opinion even if he does not agree with it and allow him to express it in peace with himself and his life according to his personal conscience, and from this difference between us, create bridges of Understanding even if it does not stem from consent..if we really expect the other peoples to respect us back, we should start by respecting ourselves and the personal choices of the people who make up this people called ""the people of Israel"". And for those who still do not get it, it is also okay, resurrection with your choice, but you can let others live as they see fit with their choices .. And here, a beautiful sunset now from the sea that will do you some good on the soul..a wonderful evening (-: https: // www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10152246828441611&set=a.10150419241011611.361230.573421610&type=1&theater",1

"You are the one who crosses the red line against the Torah and the name. How long will the Torah revolt? It is not enough if all the enemies from outside ""destroy you and destroy you"" if you are a president who calls for assimilation you miss the many and have no part in the next world you crossed the red line. Resurrection If you do not defend such cases there is a Palestinian state You are probably fit to be president There is a black day and a great mourning for the people of Israel",1
Shabbat Shalom Honorable President !!!!! lots of success !!,0
Of course the postma has the right to marry whoever she wants even with a goat. But suddenly the man becomes enlightened and forgets where he was educated in the most racist party Herut so that he will not come to teach us that he will first of all educate the fans of the biggest racist party,0

"Too bad you were in Beit Shemesh and only came to a certain population, you forgot about us",1
There are not enough words for comfort.,0
"Ruby, you are a ray of light and hope in the waves of ignorance and racism that wash over us from home. well done !",0
Successfully !! You are a dear man,0
We need to embrace this player .....,0
Mr. President. Why did you not treat your team fans ??,1
"Poor, may his memory be blessed !!!",0
"Even more outrageous are the reactions of these so-called democrats, who will go to hell all democracy if it is a democracy, democracy does not encourage assimilation, there is a democratic state here but you do not have to ride on democracy to encourage assimilation, for all respondents who support only you know The Jew you want, we saw what happened to the Jews of Europe, more than fifty percent of whom were assimilated",1

You are best suited to be president,0
"Honorable President, if there was a speaker in your house, what was your interesting response?",1
Love you Mahran,0
"We are a small nation that has been through a Holocaust and persecution throughout history. We must maintain a continuum of generations. Every Jewish woman who marries a Gentile, no matter what the origin, interrupts it. The same goes for a man. What has preserved us throughout history has been the avoidance of mixed marriages. It is not appropriate for the president to bless intermarriage",1

Dear man you are,0
Well done to the President for the brave statement.,0
Charming,0
"Dear Ruby, may you and us have a lot of success together and with the help of the name, coming to the President's house will bring you and all the people of Israel and the State of Israel lots and lots of good luck, success, health and housing for our young couples who fought like lions for the people and the only country we have.

Well done to you.Although as a president who is supposed to serve as an example you did right.Good luck,0
You are the president of the Jewish people. In his current situation it might have been good not to express an opinion (which I agree with wholeheartedly) on such a painful matter.,1

"And I'm just a small question _ quote: ""The Arabs are an integral part of the Israeli experience"" ""Perhaps the meaning:"" ""The Arabs are an integral part of the Israeli experience"" ""? After all, they live with us!""",1

Ruby I have believed in you from the beginning,0
I do not know but it seems you have a lovely woman straight force,0
You will already resign a clown,0
"Sabba, does this also apply to same-sex marriage? Divorced and Cohen? Cohen and a convert? Or in these things does darkness still rule the State of Israel?",0
Good luck on your way to the presidency because in my opinion it is not appropriate for you to be our president. Good health to you and your poetic wife and family.,0
Honorable President Rivlin with whom should peace be made with vicious murderers until when the blood of pure boys is spilled The state should take exceptional measures with Hamas and kill them completely,1

Ruby you're cute,0
"Of blessed memory . Hurt and cry his death. The Chief of Staff who stated that it was possible to return to green fields and the Minister of Defense who chose hesitation instead of decisiveness. In surrender instead of decision, the little angel was sentenced.",0
"I also think it is a real shame that you as the president of a Jewish state. Gives legitimacy to such improper and irresponsible talk. That all right of existence is according to and because of the Holy Torah which invalidates all intermarriage. ""So if you are the president of the State of Israel, the state of the Jews and not the state of any nation, you are supposed to condemn these things. And if not to condemn. Then at least you should not say things. For something that in all generations was the most sensitive issue for the Jewish people. In the Jewish nation state and I am sure you have some grandfather who was a real Jew who is ashamed and turns over in his grave from his grandson the president """" and you will be sure that the Muslims will not choose you or worship you because of these flatteries ..... in the picture below Rabbi Yosef Rivlin's grandfather.

An artist will live freedom of expression and democracy. Every person should do what his heart desires,0
"Reuven Ruby Rivlin President of the State of Israel You are just ashamed !!! The whole nation of Israel is ashamed as a Jewish person and even more ashamed as the president of the State of Israel The state of the Jews to remind you that you probably forgot you support the marriage of a Jew with an Arab ??? Why did we flee the Diaspora for intermarriage and assimilation here in the Holy Land ??? Are you crazy or what's going through your mind? You are a disgrace and it is a pity for us that you are the president of the country if these are your positions and we will have the following !! But I am sure that if it was your family member like your house or your granddaughter you would have reacted very severely and you would have prevented the disaster. I wish you that God would restore your understanding to you, that she would probably run away from you at your extreme age. I'm ashamed of you !!!!",1
"Enough to get people into the gut and private life. Throughout history, Jews have married their neighbors and survived as Jews. A little tolerance for God's sake. The Jewish people are full but full of assimilation and history proves it. In general, there is a controversy over who we are, we are in general. Even when the Jewish people wandered in the desert for 40 years, non-Jewish nomads who simply immersed themselves in it were added and observed. And in general even King David was a descendant of Shiksa a redhead.",1
"With all my heart, good luck in the presidential election, you are my choice. I also hope that next time we will bless you as President of the State of Israel.",0
Hard,0
"Shame on you, President of Gaza! And I'm sure you do not really mean it ...",1

Red line ?? Incitement ?? I have news for you. You represent the State of Israel and you incite and dishonor by supporting yesterday's wedding. There are lots of little girls who hear and internalize what you say and give them the impression that it's okay to marry an Arab. Only yesterday the bride's father cried in the media and I cried with him and you dare Wish them good luck. Shame on you and hope for you that you do not finish the priesthood.,1
You will be with the help of our President's name,0
"I still remember the warmth and affection with which you enveloped the Speaker of the Knesset, the children from families at risk, who celebrated a bar mitzvah in the Knesset. You talked to them at eye level. You asked and were genuinely interested in them. It is clear without a doubt that you are the president of the whole nation. Successfully !",0

Is a meeting with a foreign agent not a state security offense, I do not hear You're criticizing the whole thing.",1
"Hi Ruby Years ago in a military exercise you were sitting at headquarters a soldier from the second group came in and told you Boom you were killed. You smiled and answered, my dear, a word does not kill and certainly not me and you continued to conduct the exercise..so ruby ??words and those like you are thrown into space and there is really nothing in them..I believe that the good in you and the common sense in you will find the ways. I wish for you that God will succeed through you ..",0

"Is it not if you are a ketone in your eyes, you are the head of the tribes of Israel ... (Shmuel 1: 5: Yes) You talked about democracy, foundations, and Judaism, but among them you accidentally blessed your ovaries. The President of Israel is not supposed to congratulate those who work against the Israeli constitution, whatever your opinion is, to congratulate the newlyweds on their decision to marry. As president you have a responsibility to be careful in your language, the word to marry in this context is wrong. # fail",1

"With great sorrow I read that my lord met a rabbi with terrorists, the man with one ambition and that is to erase the State of Israel from the map as the history books in the PA for adulthood as well as the geography books where the word Tel Aviv does not exist and Ashkelon is Majdal and Ashdod is a small Arab village in Ashdod. I read that the President of the State of Israel on behalf of the Jewish Jewish faction considers it an honor to continue to meet with the aforementioned man of the sewers.",1
Good luck Mr. Rivlin you are a loved one .. hope there will be no such and such surprises ... Continue to be who you are,0

"Shame and disgrace that this is what the President of the State of Israel speaks and encourages assimilation within the State of Israel, even the Gentiles in Russia when they interrogated the Rebbe of the first Chabad, for writing in his Tanya book, that a Jew has a holy soul and a gentile has only a soul from the unclean shells built and set him free A Jew does not understand this, you do not understand the problem of intermarriage, so go and learn what Judaism is, it is a pity that the situation in which the President of the State of Israel encourages assimilation, and does not understand that assimilation is a disaster for the Jewish people.",1
"Mr. President ! Why are you only addressing Jews regarding racism and nationalism? .. Please address on behalf of all of us to the Arab leaders in the country who will stop the shift and hatred towards us. At the head of their leaders are the smart demagogues in the Knesset who are fueling hatred between Jews and Arabs here in Israel. Do not accuse us of racist behavior, this behavior follows the violence and hatred of the few in the Galilee, Wadi Ara and the Negev, Jaffa, Lod, Acre and East Jerusalem towards the Jews in Israel. Put things on their accuracy instead of preaching morality to us and threatening us all by legal means. You are the president of us all and we do not want to go to dark places. Therefore, Mr. President, you will invite the Arab wise men (some or all of whom were absent from the Knesset on the day of your election to the presidency) to bring down the flames of hatred between us and us.",1

Uffffffffffffffff very painful. May his memory be blessed.,0
"The president cannot be expected to start debating why marriage to a Muslim is wrong. Between us, everyone knows what Rivlin's real opinion is and everyone knows that he is a Zionist, who loves Israel and the Jewish people. If there really was a democracy here, the honorable president would indeed say what is on his mind, and what most of us think — such marriages end in utter failure. This is a spiritual war that is trying to appropriate the daughters of the Jewish people, and many Arabs will testify to that.",1

You are chosen because of your faith in the Blessed One,0

"Mr. President, the one who calls the IDF soldiers murderers and the one who waves the PLO flags and the one who shouts in the streets of Israel ""Allah oh Akbar and Arbat"" ""refers to the beginning of the end of Zionism is the one who throws stones at cars and endangers their passengers. Only those who are law-abiding and all the rest will live with our rights.

"Ruby So I understand that we are allowed to go out with Arabs and when they start murdering us against the background of desecrating the family you will condemn .... the Jews who dared to harm the sacred Arab tradition. It is a pity that Mr. President has fallen into the vicious leftist demagoguery that defines the desire to avoid intermarriage as racism. Mahmoud, if he so wished, could be accepted with open arms by the Jewish people in a kosher conversion, even though this conversion would not change his race but only his religion. On the other hand, when a person is hated without the ability to change that hatred - like the antisemitic hatred in late 19th century Europe - it is racism.",1
Pinches the heart,0
Rivlin is simply ashamed on your part to support the exaggeration this time,1
"Honorable President, With all due respect to freedom and democracy, why should we encourage the conversion of Israeli girls? Freedom and democracy is certainly not what Islam symbolizes. Is there freedom of expression here? Not when she was forced to convert to Islam. In the name of freedom and democracy one must explain more what Islam means. Are all our senses dark and unable to distinguish between light and darkness?",1

"Before 16 (I am a veteran in the country) I took paid 4,000 NIS for driving lessons, and did not pass the first test. I took more lessons for the second test but the money was not enough to take more lessons and then I stopped. Today exactly the same thing happened to me. Today the legal situation is even more difficult for people in a difficult financial situation like mine because dependence on an internal test causes all driving instructors to submit the student to an external test based on considerations of financial greed that first of all they try to spend as much money as possible on driving lessons. Still not ready ""that she's an excuse that the law recognizes as legal and that's a problem because it's being abused and spurs driving instructors to be greedy for students' money just like a loophole calling for a thief. Students 'dependence on teachers' ""considerations"" should be eliminated, and just as it is possible to approach a theoretical test when the student feels he is ready for it, so too in the practical driving test who should choose the timing to approach is the student and not someone who receives money from the student for Additional driving lessons depend on the teacher's ""discretion"" who ""believes"" that the student is not yet ready for the external test. The negligent law that exists today that hangs the student's timing to take an external test in the driving instructor hurts first and foremost people with very low incomes who can not continue to pay for additional driving lessons and get stuck even without a chance to do a second test, even without a driver's license and stuck with bigger expenses in advance. Driving lessons taken. I am currently stuck with no money to pay for more driving lessons, but in the coming months my bank account will be paid for the checks I gave to the driving school, and I am well known in the welfare bureau. Just yesterday I received from my social worker a social report to receive food from an association whose manager replied that only in September would they be tested whether to help me with food once a month. My monthly income is NIS 3,000, known and recognized by the National Insurance Institute due to functional limitations and despite the limitations I still work hard. But my only income is as stated NIS 3,000, and from it I have to pay rent, electricity, water, property taxes and expenses and always be preoccupied with surviving when every month there are commitments for current expenses and this driving lessons were such expenses that at the end of the month I will have a hard time continuing to pay. I would like to offer you to propose an amendment or legislation aimed at making it easier for low-income earners to spend on driving lessons. My idea is that some of the people who want to enlist in the army (or national service) at a later age (e.g. 30 years old), and in the meantime will be drivers, are those who in the public service will take a driving instructor course and give driving lessons in their national service or service. The military. People who want to learn to drive and do not have money, will bring a certificate from a social worker on low income and will be able to receive unlimited driving lessons. For covering the state's expenses in parking vehicles and fuel, it is possible to charge each driving student only 10 NIS per driving lesson. In such a situation, the state will be able to facilitate people like me, the public will be able to get people to take driving lessons to drive carefully on the road and prevent road accidents, and also will be able to run such a low-income driving lessons service because they will be required to pay a reduced price for driving lessons. How about formulating this idea into a bill and submitting it to the Knesset? I would love to receive feedback on my idea and your willingness to promote it into a bill / amendment to the law. Lena """,2

Two Qassam rockets exploded recently in open areas in the Sdot Negev Regional Council. No injuries or damage were reported.,2
"President Rivlin, I held you very strongly, but as soon as you gave legitimacy to assimilation ... if the situation were reversed and the Muslim converted to Judaism? The Ishmaelites would slaughter him for it without thinking twice - the goal of Hamas and all organizations want to Islam us and our daughters.",1

This is a garbage president and a dirty thief who would have been better not to shut up and not rise to such a status at all and should continue with all his might to make such demonstrations otherwise it will end very badly,1

"Poor girl Morel, left her religion, a source of living water, and went to carve in empty wells full of snakes and scorpions. And there is no one to save her from them, this is what happens, when parents divorce, there is no one to keep the flock, then come the predatory wolves, who prey on the flock, and then Rivlin and Minister German come to wish them appetite. And there is no one to save her from them. https://www.facebook.com/eitan.cabel/photos/a.599179510139317.1073741829.174411199282819/733893560001244/?type=1",1

It hurts the heart for a life cut short because of hatred.,0
An honest and Zionist honest man was elected president of our country an excellent choice and seems a suitable replacement for Mr. Peres who in my opinion and in the opinion of most of the people did his job above expectation so from here we wish both honest and edited people have plenty of health and success artist,0
In my opinion there is no one worthy of it,0
If you were going to be elected by the public the support for you would be much greater,0
Shabbat Shalom to the next President of the State of Israel,0
"Honorable President-elect Boldness of the forehead? How long will this conviction go away? Can we as a state and as a society not condemn it once and for all within the framework of the law? To keep her away from the House of Representatives whose symbol is the lamp symbol? The menorah symbolizes something pure, and in the House of Representatives sits the symbol of evil and hatred towards the Jewish people living in Zion. I will end with hope and prayer: Never again !!!! A helpless Jew will never face unjust murderers.",1
Well done to Rabbi Hanasi,0
Shabbat Shalom Mr. President,0

The lord . The state is a democratic state. So I am allowed to comment on your honor. Because you are the president of the Jewish state. Not the president of a bi-national state. Please do not forget;,1
"This is not about racism and not incitement, yes these are people who are hurt by Shabbat Yisrael assimilated and not only assimilated but converted, you and your peers can shout until tomorrow racism and incitement, I want to see one Muslim woman marry a Jewish man. You can already imagine what will happen to that one. In our case, the President of the State with all due respect should not make statements like this and certainly not ride on democracy on the subject of assimilation, this is assimilation and this phenomenon should be condemned from both Jewish and Israeli society. It is inconceivable that here in the Jewish state Does that make sense to you?",0

"Ahla man ... and now for something serious: the BTC (Bit Coin) I realized that it cost 10 ag in 2009, and today it is worth everyone a laptop (about 2300 NIS). Anyone who wanted to solve the benefit problem in the State of Israel He would take any allowance for each disabled person and buy the amount of BTC with it in 2009. This would result in the cancellation of all allowances for the entire years of life of several generations of disabled people. Each disabled person would receive 20,000 BTC coins from an allowance of NIS 2,000. Multiply by 2300 NIS (the rate is about today's) and suddenly it had: 20000 * 2300 = 46,000,000 NIS !!! And so every poor person would become a multi-millionaire ... but someone was afraid to inform the disabled about this .. lest they become influential and powerful! Because the disabled (in general disability) do not have the money to buy cellphones, computers, etc ... Even the calculation between getting to the hospital and medication and public transportation is a daily calculation for them ... at least you will grant an exemption to the disabled when traveling by public transport ...",0
"Dear Guy Oren, With this chosen one with a racist, whether you like it or not! I'm not saying it is mandatory to hate but definitely to be different from others! And that is what made us survive 3300 years to the present day against every reasonable chance possible!",2
Sorry sir but a Jewish state does not go with a democratic and by the way this democracy has brought us to the sad situation that the people of Israel are in and of course they will revolt we with one heart one and she is our sister who is going to perish so what we will not hurt sorry very painful,1

Many thanks to President Reuven Rivlin. Finally a leader rises up and condemns racism. I wish this would create a huge wave of sane leadership that first and foremost condemns racism and violence. Thank you sir.,0
"Mr. President, I think that a person in your position and status is expected to condemn the ""exclusion of women"" performed by the commander of the Givati ??Brigade, who canceled the performance of singer Sarit Hadad (after it was already closed as a free performance for soldiers) in favor of a male singer (Moshe Peretz ""In my place, regardless of my lord's.

More pure forever,1
Our President King love you Ruby,0
Severely disappointed in you. I would like to see your girl or granddaughter marry an Arab and more become one. What a chair can do and that's just a chair.,1
"That's right, Mr. President. We are a free people, but I have seen that if you wave the blue and white Israeli flag in Israel, you will be arrested. What free people in our country are you talking about?",1
"I'm tired of hearing from you reactions of racism, I'm sure you would cry day and night if your daughter was subjected to severe and shocking violence, and the hand of the brothers ""works hard to get those labs to freedom .. racism ?! We are Jews and a Jew is marrying Judith !!! You will be ashamed and even more ashamed that the President of the State of Israel is giving it a hand! It is a pity that there is no referendum on the election of a president",1
Peace to all of Israel Amen,0
"Not pretty ! So to speak at the time came three children were abducted and are in terrible danger! At this time all our people are in unity in prayer and crying and doing everything for their return home in peace !! This is neither the time nor the place to joke or lash out at who or what stupid stupid statements are justified or not thats not the point right now! And for those who claim that it is forbidden to ride hitchhiking and could not drive, pay attention !! There is no organized transportation in the area, so it is possible that only hitchhiking is the way out. I believe there will be an investigation and conclusions will be drawn and whoever has to give the verdict, by the way, the police can also be a serious part of the matter why despite receiving a kidnapping report they did not send a mobile to check! ?? And only an hour later, under pressure from the parents, did they realize that this was probably a call, as mentioned, a patrol car that passed by the place an hour later reported that there was nothing unusual !! So there is a chance that if the police had taken seriously jumping into an area of ??security forces maybe the situation would have been different! But do not judge and right now we all need the people of Israel not to give up and not to give up shouting to heaven to score prayer gates for their return home healthy and intact without any damage and as soon as possible !! The State of Israel must make a clear conclusion if and when it turns out that Hamas abducted or linked to the abduction apparently we should have passed the terrorists law and killed any terrorist or not given the opportunity to talk or negotiate if terrorism but unfortunately the Shalit deal motivated the terrorists to carry out more full abductions Just as a gesture for them to talk to us, I will answer for a peace agreement, only did worse, we will not be surprised if they are being held or were connected here by terrorists that Netanyahu and this group distributed to them as a gift !! When will you understand if terrorism is not talk there is power and deeds !! ""Our brethren, all the house of Israel, who are in trouble and captivity who stand between the sea and the land, the place will have mercy on them and bring them out of distress from darkness into the light of the shrine and at the time of sacrifice and say Amen !! Pay attention! Psalms are said in this time of trouble are KK """" A, Blessed is he who prays more !! """,1

"Until it shatters and shatters to pieces all the lies of Western medicine treating patients in methods that are appropriate for the days of adolescence there is no reason to give organs to such a corrupt system, which has chosen to sanctify only suffering and death instead of sanctifying life. Today's nutritionists are tomorrow's doctors, and today's doctors are tomorrow's nutritionists, who will give Ruby and open your eyes and cooperate with the brave like Feiglin Zandberg, who did not agree to be hesitant of Teva & Co. Lose Your Business Medicine is not a business but a life",2
"By the way about your sister, she may have been well educated, but you sure are not. Maybe she will not marry an Arab but I wish her that an Arab would seduce her even for a moment, and then you will have a nephew who knew how to renovate the house better than everyone else in the Gabriel Makhlouf family ... sounds appropriate.",1

A worthy choice of a worthy man has undoubtedly risen and succeeded ..,0
Good luck in your new role I knew you were our next president,0
It is a great honor for us that the honor of the president is human and death and joy are at the forefront of his eyes and his participation in them is out of a desire and duty to represent the leaders of our people. There is no willingness and desire to be present where they are expected and it is a pity ...,0

"Mr. President, why does no one condemn the Israeli Arabs who celebrate every soldier killed? The answer is in the media from where one should start. Every racist call makes headlines within seconds of a month. But cries from the other side of violence and murder are not heard in the media Interesting Why? The time has come for order in the country.",1
well done !!!,0

"Mr. President, you are right in every word. I really dislike and even disgust myself at the thought that a Jewish girl will throw the history and tremendous tradition of her people in the trash and marry a Gentile, (and not necessarily because he is an Arab) whose family and people probably do not love her people so much. But we live in a democratic state, it is neither the first nor the last to do so unfortunately, but its will must be respected. The problem here is not that she is marrying an Arab, the problem here is that she is marrying a non-Jew and her sons will not be Jews. She detaches her history from her people, her sons and her grandchildren. She will give the judgment up, but we must not do so.",1

"In my humble opinion the Honorable President did not have to respond at all! Words of wisdom are not here! We are Jews and we must try to eradicate the phenomenon of assimilation in our people, and not ""align"" with our haters and detractors of our religion, even if unfortunately they come from within us!

"If God forbid Ruby Rivlin wins the presidency today, it will be a very sad day for the State of Israel.

Ruby Rivlin voted against the denial of the pension of the spy Azmi Bishara Shrigal in favor of Hezbollah Ruby Rivlin A friend of Ahmad Tibi who says he does not recognize the State of Israel as a Jewish state is this the next president of the State of Israel ??? Shame !!!!!!!!!!!",0
Democracy will further overthrow the State of Israel !!! Why is it forbidden to hunt animals? Why is it forbidden to raise an eagle at home? Why is it forbidden to go through the red democracy !!!!!! Why is Christianity forbidden to spread in the country ??? democracy !!! The freedom of poop! This is what you will begin to learn and understand that we are walking according to the divine democracy,1
Udi and it's still supposed to be a fan more it's a big stakeholder and elected in the most undemocratic way and indicted just people. Ruby Rivilin will be ashamed of you I wish your granddaughter would marry an Arab and frustration and get beaten by them and raped because that is what they do to our daughters ..,1
Well done !!!,0

Pride for the people and the country.,0
"We are a small nation that has been through a Holocaust and persecution throughout history. We must maintain a continuum of generations. Every Jewish woman who marries a Gentile, no matter what the origin, interrupts it. The same goes for a man. What has preserved us throughout history has been the avoidance of mixed marriages. It is not appropriate for the president to bless intermarriage",1

"The democracy you mean contradicts Judaism which is our only excuse to hold on to this land !! Free from laws and mitzvos?!?!? So it is better to throw democracy into the sea, it is better to have a British mandate .. Shame and disgrace that a ""president"" in the name of the presidents who were in the people of Israel allows assimilation !! Assimilation !! Hang the keys already the country has collapsed !! """,1
"Honorable President, I would take your word with great understanding if as President you would say what you say when a lot of Arabs go out every day and night in demonstrations and death cries to Jews and lots of Arabs who live in the country and take advantage of the benefits the state gives and make a living from If you, as President of the State, find it appropriate to condemn all the anti-Israel organizations that live among us and in time of war call our soldiers murderers and criminals but unfortunately did not find it appropriate to do so then forgive me if I am not at all willing to accept from you the statement of racism. So for those you came out to defend are the people that the Israeli police need to investigate and one more thing Mr. President I would start with the outspoken haters of Israel who sit in the Knesset and do not miss any opportunity to slam and spread hatred and abomination towards us Jews. And another point to think about when the citizens of the country see what is happening in the Knesset and around the country that we hated in every way trying to harm and murder us and the Israeli police do not give an answer even when there are citizens who complain so it is possible and desirable to understand that the people are tired of it !! So let's not act like the nation that knows and sees exactly who the terrorist is but gives the terrorist what. And finally, Mr. President, one thing with Israel is alive and well forever",1
It's not fair ! It's not fair ! no no no . ... my heart finds it hard to believe that such a thing happened. That this sweet boy is buried and that his father and mother are eager to stroke his hair again and kiss his cheeks again. .. What will ?? ??? I'm really asking. I'm just amazed and terribly sad. ...,0
Long live the President of the State of Israel,0
"Ruby Rivlin does not encourage assimilation !!! He is trying to show the way to a sane life in a law-abiding democratic state !!! Assimilation has always been ... the fact that 3,000 and something a year after Abraham some of his children with fair skin and some with dark skin is probably not just because Ethiopia has more sun than Russia ... and yet the people of Israel are alive and well ... Assimilation was a danger That we survived in the Diaspora and because of its so marginal percentage here within the State of Israel, it is clear that this is not what endangers us ... What is endangered is free hatred, incitement and racism ..",0
Sorry mistake this is the pomegranate blossom,2
"Mr. President, you continue not to surprise me. I always knew you were an honest and true man. I am personally against intermarriage but as you said democracy is the name of the game and unfortunately a lot of citizens know how to write the word democracy but do not refer to its content at all, or do not understand what democracy is, and I am glad to be called to explain to all anti-democrats what democracy is. Well done, Mr. President",0
So why not enforce the law and incitement is a criminal offense,0
"Addressing the President of the State of Israel is obligatory with respect to the President, since we are not your personal friend, Mr. Amsalem. The dignity and freedom of every person is to do as he pleases. The couple in question represent Israeli society and its cooperative future with different populations. There are Israeli Arabs who are more Zionist than you and me and have contributed and are contributing a lot to his country. I wish everyone to sober up from the cynicism and understand that this is a democratic state and not a state of halakhah.",0
"Honorable President-elect, I especially remember how much you have stood on your hind legs, in recent years, to allow these representatives and emissaries of these terrorists in the Knesset, to harm Zionism and Zionists even within the legislature, under the hallucinatory ""freedom of speech"" and other excessive liberal calls. You support you as president. """,1

"A militant group is developing here whose explicit purpose is to cause a rift and tension between us and the Arabs of the country, in my opinion their activity should be cut short when they are still in diapers. They are similar to those who do price tags in secret and in the dark, and they do so under the auspices of the media. They must not be given a stage even in the name of democracy and freedom of speech .. that they talk as much as they want but do not have to press them and invite them every time to TV ..

A state of halakhah is but a democratic state of the Zionist nation in the spirit of the Declaration of Independence, where freedom of religion and freedom of choice are also emphasized. As a Zionist, I strive for exemplary society, after all, """" Tseder Tzedek will persecute "" Who to love and not racist.

The President of the State of Israel is ashamed and disgraced. Speaks in such a way. What happened to him he forgot what a Jew is and how difficult it was for my grandparents and for everyone who was in the Holocaust and before keeping from assimilation you should be silent if at least she did not condemn.,1

"Not to support racism is a minimum necessary to expect a president of a country that claims to be democratic. Now, how did it happen that Arab citizens receive such treatment? Maybe you should check, for example, Mr. Rivlin, all the racial laws passed by the previous Knesset that you were its chairman. This is not a head-scratching of extremism, the racist fish stinks from the head. Oh and, the Arab citizens of Israel are just citizens, who are supposed to be equal, they are not a set Exotic ""for the Israeli experience"" "". """,1

"Honorable President Reuven Rivlin I am shocked by your opinion, a democratic state comes after a Jewish state and we are forbidden assimilation !! I am not religious until there is a red line where we Jews are not allowed to assimilate and this is the opinion of many of the people. And we are a free people in our country because Muslims are trying to expel us from our country !! So the honorable president we will not beautify and wish a couple health happiness because in a few years we taxpayers we will have to worry ha and her 5 children who were in the shelter after her husband beat her so sorry I do not agree with the honorable president do not forget where you came from and where you will be strong in our country !!!!!",1
Honorable President I appreciate you fighting those racists who are destroying society.,0
"Boring and predictable post ... you forgot to mention what Sakhnin fans are doing on the pitches. Somehow this is always what the Jews do (and no, I do not justify racism). But if this country belongs to everyone according to what you claim from being elected president, then you will require everyone - and not just the Jews - to behave properly. It seems that you have reviews only towards Jews! It's getting embarrassing already ... I also have a dream, that you all stop being cheap populists! Your dream and that of the late Martin Luther King will most likely come before my dream. Shabbat Shalom Honorable President.",1

Now that your partner Mahmoud will erase his name and his memory ""will take ownership"" of you the things that might have seemed standard until now - will be reversed. Not far from Mahmoud's house, a few years ago a woman shirt, a Jew like you, with severe mental and physical scars after years of hell this world, for years she was obliged to welcome her husband who returned from work every day with a bowl of warm soapy water for the feet and a hookah lit, when she was Forgetting or not enough she feels in her flesh the smoke of a damaged memory ... This is just one of many examples of the black future that awaits you, go to the far shore a spitting distance from Mahmoud's house and watch how the wives of Israeli Arabs coming to the sea dressed - yes, exactly Like anywhere else, with no relief while their husbands bounce in the water with a lightweight boxer shorts. Morale, if things had not stopped only for the comfort of your life and your personal safety - Dayan, many people make mistakes and pay with their bodies / finances / sanity, etc ... But the harm does not end with the duty to wake up before your husband every morning or in any meeting where strangers I will have to be silent and not make a fuss, the harm is to all your people, and yes, I say 'your people' because the fact that you converted to Islam a few days ago in the Muslim court in Jaffa in Tel Aviv does not matter in any way the fact that you were and will remain forever. Is an unpardonable sin and a sign of disgrace to you and all of us will be dependent, Gd will sit up and upright with great sorrow, sorrow that will return to you like a bourgeoisie throughout your marriage to the scum that has accompanied you for two years ... Morale, we do not hate you This coming Sunday we will come to the unfortunate event you are about to hold, but do you know why we will be there? Mainly so that you will see that we stand with your face to you and not with your back, as our sister you should remember that we will always wait to save you from the villain who captured your heart and performs the sixth Hukran commandment to harm Jews by sexual assault. I very much hope, also for you, that you will sober up and do the right thing today, and if not ... we will stand there with a boiling heart but with a constant readiness to receive a ring from you. Yours, Yossi Davidov",2

I have not heard any of them speak in praise of Israel or condemn aggression against Israel or turn out to be an Israel fan ... In his name and we will come out of the illusion of ""coexistence"" because they prove time and time again to whom they belong with whom they identify and how much they hate us ... regardless of what they get from us. The difference between us and them is that we sanctify every person as a person and they hate a Jew as a person. So I very much respect the opinion of the President of the State who is the President of the State of all its citizens. The only question to be asked is what are the criteria for true citizenship and loyalty to the homeland. """,1

"Cheating flatterers are you heretics in the Torah ??! So on what basis do you sit in the land of you robbers, use the right of the Torah and spit on its laws? Conquerors! Thieves! You have no right to sit in this country, Bolsheviks !! Flatterer Oh, our Torah is more than your hallucinatory democracy Algae does not see morality as your home or belongs to you but we with Israel are one family, I understand you flatter the left in court that they will not throw you off the chair but you know you symbolize the end of Israel because you have no interest in Judaism You are conquering the land from the Arabs and the Jews! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDdx_Jzujh8",1
Love you Ruby ... salute you Mr. President,0
Cute !!,0
Right this is her full right even though I would not want it to happen in my house but this !! Her full right.,0

"Mr. President, I sympathize with the tendency against intermarriage !!!! But I, along with you, identify like you with human dignity and the freedom of his privacy to decide how his life will be conducted on the family plane. In doing so, I, as a Jew and an Israeli, find it appropriate to condemn those who in their opinion have acquired the right to enter the veins of the other and try to determine for them how their private lives will be conducted. With the help of the name, the extremists (members of all religions !!) will be removed from our lives.",0
"Honorable President, during your tenure, there will be unity among the people of Israel following your leadership, and then free love will come, and then ... Good luck!",0
Why did I not hear condemnation of Arab terrorism? Have you already started being Simon?,1
"All these idiots who respond here with curses against our president, you are welcome to pass on ""beautiful words"" to your parents, they will be happy !! To what low level do you lower yourself that you speak like this to the President of the State of Israel?!?! Go look for a life that people are resentful !! This couple who wants to get married right !! They are not the first and certainly not the last to do so so do not look for things to do demonstrations on and mess with them instead you are welcome to look for lifeless employment and I am sure 90% of you without work are unemployed such who sit all day and smoke",1
Shabbat Shalom with good news in H. E.,0
Happy holiday Mr. President Birkat Tel Hai from Tel Aviv,0
Well done for your popularity our dear President.,0
Ruby I am your ardent supporter and I know that you are also very very much against this wedding but as president you are committed to the state and the law so you must not express an opinion against the wedding but at least maybe it is better that you shut up or tie your hands than typing again and do not always better,1
Good luck sir,0
"A president does not always have to say his opinion. His silence would have respected him more. Sorry for the seal you gave them and who knows what a day child. It is a pity that you ignored the fact that if an Arab marries a Jew she is sentenced to death. So what approval did you give to the new couple when a Muslim converted to Judaism and married her? I was very, very, very disappointed ...",1
"I'm with you . And to the woman with whom you moved me very much, you talked about the simplicity of the praise of the relationship and the great pleasure from them that you will succeed as an artist in family life and with God's help and be elected president because only you are suitable",0
.... to be a free people in our country ...,1
"Why go to the World Cup? What is being done there? Just shame! It is better to concentrate, raising the level first,. Shabbat Shalom Nasi.",0
"Rivlin, you are one of the great disappointments of the sane public in Israel, regret your election as president.",1
The right thing to do was to avoid expressing your opinion about intermarriage. You do not always have to respond and keep your details private. Do not forget that you now represent an entire country.,1
The president of the team !!!,0
Do not ignore rhythm. Open transcripts of interrogation and reveal the injustice to the world.,1
"Bless you, President of the State of Israel. Great work ahead of us in dealing with racism, incitement and violence against the Arab citizens of Israel. It is not appropriate for you - by virtue of your status and by virtue of your long-standing position on this issue - to lead the campaign. Be strong and courageous",0
You are the most worthy and suitable candidate to be President of the State ..... Good luck .. !!!!!,0
Everything bees in the field there is nothing,0
"Hi Rubik, how does a green ball get along with a blue tie ?? (-:",0
"Mr. President, more than ""these expressions gnaw at the foundations of our common life here ..."", gnaws assimilation into the continued existence of the people of Israel. You chose to quote Ze'ev Jabotinsky in things that were not necessarily said in the context of the issue while Jabotinsky felt contempt for the phenomenon of assimilation. """,1
A leader of the State of Israel should not speak like that !! We need to maintain a Jewish character !! Assimilation must not be encouraged !! This is a holy state of Jews !!,1
What a cute grandson. And to you the President of the State Good luck.,0
"Thank you, Mr. President, for the brave and sane voice you make here. I and many others will be proud to see you at the head of a campaign to eradicate the racist cancer within us and as a symbolic first step, it would have been good if law and enforcement authorities had given their opinion on those responsible for the ugly reactions on this page itself. No need to go far.",0
You deserve to win! You are an amazing person with principles! Successfully !!,0
The little pleasures ... really fun,0
Congratulations you deserve to forget the State of Israel good luck !!!,0
He hopes to have power - that means he's already a little energy epic believing in himself chewed because Peres did not even for a moment have doubts about his powers choosing Peres for another round of office!,0
The tears flow by themselves,0
"Honorable President, (and I have a great deal of respect for you!) If this was your daughter ?? How much would you respect her 'will' ??",1
"Mr. President, what happened to Yitzhak Artzog? He does not know anything about the wars, so he sat quietly.",1
"Paradoxically, the audience you are targeting this post Mr. President does not know half of the words you use.",0
Shabbat Shalom and blessed our dear President,0
Here he began to move left and believe in the enemy,1
Direct and true on his way straight to power ..,0
"As much as you answered is similar to you, exactly",0
Do not confuse the mind,1
"What a closing of a sad circle really hurts the heart, may his memory be blessed Amen",0
Honorable President Reuven Rivlin Thank God we have a president like you.,0
"Oh, clothed that this is the President of the State of Israel !!!",1
Not to forget that a president is not allowed to express a political position so he only spoke from democracy and take a good good look he wrote that it has nothing to do with his views,1
"From grandfather to grandfather, well done. And may you have the strength to land.",0
Shabbat Shalom Honorable President All the best,0
Too bad it was the fate of a boy who processed his childhood,0
Mr. President of the State .... Your words strengthen freedom of expression and choice and open the door to a free life and bring man closer to being a free man because that is our destiny on earth ... Honest power,0
Successfully !!!,0
Mazel Tov ! Successfully !!!,0
A noble man with supreme splendor and above all you made the people of Israel happy with the fact that you were elected President of the State and wish you success,0
Your very beautiful status Rivlin !!!,0
The question is whether he is proud of his country ...,1
Pain hurts may his memory be blessed,0
"Mr. President, in the spirit of your words, it seems that at the end of the term he will no longer have a Jew to be president ...",1
A humble and loving king and queen,0
"Shabbat is blessed for you and your family. I have a request for you and your wife, show this people that you were humble and will remain modest even when you are in the President's House and make sure to cut your predecessor's eye-catching budget!",0
For those who think they are right http://tarbut.cet.ac.il/ShowItem.aspx?ItemID=15475635-602c-4364-ba67-ccda3fb5b2a9&lang=HEB,1
Success and health to the owner of the country's No. 1 Dar box and his family,0
"Blessed be his memory, the universe of his blood",0
President of Glory. Keep it up .,0
Tell me why you reveal to him what he knows but in his personality Rivlin knows how to rise above ego in nobility,0
"Enough with talk and comfort, need to eliminate them and as soon as possible! Unfortunately they will be another number like me! Imminent death sentence for terrorists !!!",1
How painful it is that this is how you start a term ... a bad feeling.,0
"Shabbat Shalom Honorable President, Israel has received the most suitable person for the position of modesty The person and honesty in you Long live the President of the State of Israel",0
"Dear Nehama and Ruby: How exciting, how touching, so much comfort from which great hope grows: Come up and succeed, be blessed! A successful and upright presidency, a presidency of the entire nation that you will have the honor of President Reuven Ruby Rivlin, strong and courageous!",0
It's not hard to find that despite everything you see that Ruby has the kindness and love of man in his eyes that no political struggles could change and I forgot he has the same house in front of my son Begin :),0
"Long live the President of the State of Israel, long live long live Shabbat Shalom",0
This is what a society looks like where one decides to persecute people only because Allah / God has said. Put it in your head before you mess up the page with all sorts of primitive nonsense,0
Mr. Reuven Rivlin May your tenure be blessed for the people of Israel.,0
"A president who has opinions like yours in relation to Judaism is better than a country without a president, especially your opinions regarding assimilation to Japan, who said your opinion, I appreciated you and you got me down from the poor. How else do you even try to talk about this week's Torah portion?",1
Amen,0
Ruby There's no doubt you're a gentile,1
What fun you are president. A charming man. lots of success : - ),0
Ruby you will be ashamed that the president of the state of Israel which is the state of the Jews will say such a thing the most serious thing there is assimilation with Israel people like you destroy the people of Israel shame you are not the president I am not against good Arabs I am against assimilation I wish you would take the granddaughters Arabs see what you would say!,1
"All these instigators will have no resurrection, shame and disgrace. May the young couple succeed!",0
He will not be elected president in the end,0
In honor of the new president who will continue the work of the president who came out and the Ilan children will continue to visit the president's daughter every year as it was with the previous president it was always exciting to come,0
Ruby you are a king ..... May God bless you and your family and all the people of Israel for another two weeks and we will have the best president of the State of Israel for many generations to come.,0
Congratulations to you Rivlin the incoming president in your very beautiful speech !!!!,0
sad,0
"Mothers of soldiers against B'Tselem For anyone who cares about the state, please share (Like not enough). As of 11.02 today 28.8.14 - Days after the murder, B'Tselem organization did not condemn the murder of civilians in the Eshkol Council by IDF Zeev (Zevik) Etzion, 55, Shahar Melamed, 43 helped us grow to 100,000 people so we can Establish the largest demonstration since the establishment of the state !!! We argue that a ""human rights organization"" that unilaterally surveys internationally against the IDF is in fact a political movement and the Law on Party Financing (Restriction of Contributions from Abroad) should be applied to it, meaning that the law should be changed to include Also """" political movements, and so we will stop the Silver River from abroad to B'Tselem.

"Mr. President, he rose and succeeded. Lots of health. Your role is an image of the State of Israel and the people of Israel. And I personally believe in your abilities and trust you. Israeli Arabs should also be used as leverage and shared everywhere. The sector has potential and should be used to its advantage. It is time for all of us to understand that we have no other country. Misha Zidane. Kfar Manda.",0
"Mr. President Good luck in your new role, believe and love you",0
I wonder what you would write if your daughter would choose to marry an Arab or your son would choose the Arab nipple for a woman,1
"The edge of our souls in the hostile evenings forced by the good. The recent riots all over the country and the identification of the Arabs everywhere with their murderous people leaves no hope for the fulfillment of the dream of peaceful coexistence in the country, a dream that education and the media are trying to persuade the public in vain. As the ruling establishment flatters the Arabs to please them, the public's opposition to this transparent hypocrisy will increase and their hatred of the Arabs will increase. In the meantime, there has been a disillusionment among the Jewish public and it will be expressed with the help of the name in the upcoming elections ...",1
Who love you,0
First read Rashi's commentary and then in the thousand thousand differences Z. Botinsky first of all God and then the rest there is a limit to hypocrisy,1
"And I also have a small request from you, Your Honor. Maybe now you will take advantage of your status and bring us to Beitar Jerusalem your beloved team some player or two or ten but let them be really really good.",0
"Ruby So I understand that we are allowed to go out with Arabs and when they start murdering us against the background of desecrating the family you will condemn .... the Jews who dared to harm the sacred Arab tradition. It is a pity that Mr. President has fallen into the vicious leftist demagoguery that defines the desire to avoid intermarriage as racism. Mahmoud, if he so wished, could be accepted with open arms by the Jewish people in a kosher conversion, even though this conversion would not change his race but only his religion. On the other hand, when a person is hated without the ability to change that hatred - like the antisemitic hatred in late 19th century Europe - it is racism.",1
Tin President! Unnecessary institution,1
"Honorable President Ruby Rivlin, I did not think that you, even slightly encouraged by assimilation ... and erased the Torah of Moses with a wave of your hand .... You do not deserve to be called President of the State of Israel !!!! The Lord? Moshe Rabbeinu and Torat Yisrael precede you !!!! Without the laws of the Torah, there is no Israel !!!! So who are you president ???? I did not expect this response from you ... this is a direct violation of the Torah of Israel ... and of Moshe Rabbeinu by ""the ..."" and I distinguished you from all nations ""Mixed marriage and assimilation is one of the crimes of Israel !!!! And you as president do not condemn ???? And more protects this criminal act ??? Now in Parashat Va'atchanan we read this prohibition ...",1
The name will bleed and the authorities must keep the killers away and never release them.,1
Well done to Rabbi Hanasi,0
Good luck Mr. President,0
Good luck Honorable President-elect,0
Shame is the bread and salt these days.,0

And Benzi Govstein, and the Lehava organization and their racist friends who spread and preach hatred of the unthinking man, who are ashamed of the Jewish people and the democratic state of Israel, and of humanity in general, forgot the words of one of their teachers, Rabbi Akiva Who said ""and love your neighbor as yourself"" ..",0
You to Miri Regev !!!!!!!,1
Tears flow and it is hard to believe that such a child was killed all in his house the protected place with my parents who guarded him and the most precious thing in life was not caught,0
We are at the end of the barren freedom. And he was not nice to those very sad.,1
Dear Ruby .... The call that should come out is one small thing to give death sentences to terrorists ..... let there be martyrs and many martyrs but if there are dead their bodies should be wrapped in pig skin and their body dirt should be thrown into the sea ..... One nation that ruled the land and this nation was called England so if they were allowed why should we not? ....... I would love an answer from you !!!,0
Amen ! What a lovely kid! The debt is torn! Why did he not keep it?,0

Very exciting ... you have a lovely husband I got to know him when I worked at the Likud House in King George he is just lovely in every sense of the word and I really think he deserves to be elected tomorrow so lots and lots of success tomorrow you will be the next President of the State of Israel,0
Racism in reactions is shocking. Just shocking.,0
"No no, that's, I'm pretty sure you're the one to be ashamed of.",1
Former chairman of the group President of the State? There is no one as big as Betar.,0
Well done I wish they would listen to you as much as possible,0
Very nice to see what your wife wrote I would be very happy since you will be chosen since you are the most deserving of all successfully,0
Lots of success in honor of the President!,0
Grandchildren are the real interest rate. The right or obligation interest does not matter.,0
Ruby will be a wonderful president and Nehama will be an aide against him.,0
What a poor boy so sad: (,0
Success in your new position Honor us but .. I would prefer you as the next Prime Minister because we do not have more people like you Salt of the earth and it is a pity to me personally despite my personal unfamiliarity with you you give a feeling as a trustworthy and honest person you will have all good and lots of health,0
Understand you in what is written and cursed the president even though the issue is very sensitive but should not include everyone as unemployed and weed smokers ...,1
Shabbat Shalom Honorable President ... We have a dream ...,0
"With all the respect I have for the Israeli people who unite in times of war and help each other, I can not respect those of those who put their nose in matters not theirs, a Jewish woman who fell in love with an Arab man and wants to marry him is causing an almost national storm just because she fell in love with a person They sit comfortably in their heads because he was born from another nation that is not a member of the Jewish people, have mercy on them. What the hell is your business with whom she wants to marry, a Jew, an Arab, a monkey or a rooster? It is her free personal choice that stems from what her heart guides her, she does not force her personal choice on your life, and just wants to marry quietly and peacefully, so who are you to tell her if her heart fell in love with the right person or not? Our people must grow up quickly from this pathetic and prying childhood that grips them, in which they try to force their beliefs and opinions on the other if they do not sit in the exact same box in which they were raised. Unity in the people does not mean ""unity in the people"", otherwise Mr. Fate, unity in the people is to respect each other's opinion even if he does not agree with it and allow him to express it in peace with himself and his life according to his personal conscience, and from this difference between us, create bridges of Understanding even if it does not stem from consent..if we really expect the other peoples to respect us back, we should start by respecting ourselves and the personal choices of the people who make up this people called ""the people of Israel"". And for those who still do not get it, it is also okay, resurrection with your choice, but you can let others live as they see fit with their choices .. And here, a beautiful sunset now from the sea that will do you some good on the soul..a wonderful evening (-: https: // www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10152246828441611&set=a.10150419241011611.361230.573421610&type=1&theater",1
"I'm just disappointed in you, Mr. Rivlin. You politicians are enough for your lick just to be liked by people. You do not think there is a law ??! Hales already! Why are there no people here in our society with courage ?!",1
"And there is a lot of respect for the President of the State of Israel. Honorable President Reuven Rivlin. May the memory of the boy Daniel, Blessed be the name of his blood.",0
The president of the Jewish state must not encourage assimilation..this is what his honor does..It is better not to express an opinion..the greatest enemy of the Jewish people is assimilation ..... Good day and think before you express an opinion.,1
An inconceivable reality,0
"Hate politicians because they are all liars, hate politicians because they sit on the chair they forget, they become predators and what matters is how many are in the pockets, human rights are trampled, the weaker classes are forgotten, if they have food or an oven to light it is not important the main thing is their pockets full. But I was surprised to see a crying president who has feelings and his father's grave goes, praying I was surprised to read his wife's letter that he is charming and exciting there is finally a person sitting up who is whole hearted and hopes he will not change because the old is better than the new because there were people with morals",0

"The president is right. Agree with every word of yours and the pair looks great. Just a little question for me to you and all the other supporters: If this was your daughter, would you think so? Would you write like that? Disclosure: I do not. It's okay as long as it's not in your house ... truth is one. I have no two faces. Not a politician. Suri.",1
"What happened ? Since you became president you have started flattering Arabs! Shame on you ! Then she will be beaten to death, to whom will she turn? You ??",1
The Honorable President should not express such a pious opinion on this matter and more on Facebook The Jewish people survived thanks to their desire to remain a Jew. There are no Muslims who convert and their family accepts it there is no democracy and in addition To the army and will occasionally demonstrate against us,1
The same God who created the only one commanded you not to marry them,1
Congratulations dear man today you have been elected president but will always remain a dear friend to us,0
"Shame! If the US, UK, France, Russia or even the Netherlands had a similar case happen to them do you really think they would have thought at all to start messing around whether the other countries would condemn it or not or ask for prayers?!?. To her and turns their lives into hell until she brings them back to their home and also for the sake of seeing and seeing. You have become blind and cowardly slaves !!!!! Begin turns over in his grave",0
"Mr. President, everything is right. Just a small question at your disposal - are Jews also allowed to marry a Muslim Arab and maintain their freedom in our democratic state? This, of course, before her family members slaughter him ?? ... Will a leader from the Muslim community also come out in such a case and support the move ?? I do not think so ....",1
Disappointed with you ... that you will encourage assimilation ??? Shame on me .. If your daughter were to marry Mahmoud you would bury yourself Honorable President,1

Exemplary. This voice is so important and so lacking. You prove it is possible to be national and enlightened. The belligerent and horrific reactions show how important it is for the leadership that considers itself national to take responsibility and set the boundaries.,0

"The defense minister and the prime minister are lying to the public with a determined forehead, regarding Israel's legitimacy to continue fighting, even when it is offered a ceasefire. A ceasefire is not an agreement to end the war, it is an agreement to temporarily cease hostilities, and this seemingly small difference is very large. As long as the enemy did not propose a ceasefire and offered only a ceasefire, the IDF has the legitimacy to continue fighting, until the goal is reached, a ceasefire. So only this lie, this lie has legs ... the lie of grace and the vanity of beauty .....",1

Menachem Begin and Ze'ev Jabotinsky Peace would certainly not agree to this assimilation and even some of its opponents, since there is no Jewish blood involved in foreign blood !!! Moreover, these leaders called on the people of Israel to be united among themselves and not to invade beyond that !!!! revolt and weep over your words, esteemed president! """,1

"Hello, Your Honor, the President shares with you a unifying and authoritative way in which ultra-Orthodox and secular right-wingers and leftists understand that this party nonsense is weakening and our true power as a people and society lies in the ways of love and unity ... I will not burden you because all messages are on my page. And the connection of a great many citizens ... I will only attach a passage from a hymn that, although not sent to the radio, is well known and buzzing, especially in Sderot and the periphery: ""Even this for together, there are ways to embrace fear if we reject disagreements and unite forces, this too will pass together.""

Really awful to me. President of the country Maybe we will also have an Arab president because they are multiplying What do you think? Or an Arab prime minister? You are disappointing,1
"Dear President, Hello! I do not believe that the President of the State of Israel condemns the defenders of assimilation marriage, I prayed for your election as President and since you were elected you have only been disappointing. You will know who knows if at this time you came to the kingdom when you will proudly call against such marriages, but you will know that not a widow of Israel, and you and your family here in the Holy Land thanks to the hardship of the righteous in all generations trying to destroy us by all means if not by force. In order for them to be prepared to bring Christ and receive him, God has granted us to live in the Holy Land and precisely here we do the opposite of what is expected of the eternal people, in the democratic name that destroys every good part, I hope that from this great darkness we will go to redemption immediately. We will save this malicious government.",1

"I wonder what the late Menachem Begin would have thought of your words. I guess he would have been ashamed. And here are his words: intermarriage and the danger of assimilation ""True, there has been a ban on marriage between Jews and non-Jews since ancient times. Is this racism? If so, perhaps our Hebrew language, to which we have adhered, is also racist? What have we dealt with in this language? It has been forgotten for generations. No, we said, we will speak Hebrew. How we clung to this land, how we prayed for rains in it, thousands of miles away from it. When no benefit has come to us from this prayer? Or is it racism? True, the Jewish people have unity and uniqueness in it, otherwise it would not exist. On the contrary, every progressive will take the stage and tell us - I have another suggestion: he will close the room and say to himself - would the people have existed, had it not been for this prohibition? Had he not disappeared along with mighty peoples from him and would no male have remained, or would he have remained but a male, from him. The little against the many - had to be kept. Had intermarriage been permitted, not even a remnant and a refugee would have remained of us. Our people could number between 200 and 250 million people, because it is one of the oldest peoples on earth whose thread of existence has not been severed even one day for thousands of years. Why are there only three to ten million left? Two reasons for this: the massacre and the assimilation. And who knows if the assimilation did not take what the massacre took. Certainly many millions in all generations. Were it not for this prohibition, we would have long since been assimilated. There are those who claim: in fact, why should this people exist? He suffers, others suffer. We, the Jews and the Zionists, did not accept the Torah of disappearance. We seek no justification for our existence. We do not seek any recognition of our right to exist, neither from a king, nor from a general, nor from a ruler, nor from a government, nor from any other nation or language. We exist. Our right to exist, and we will continue to exist. We do not want to get off the stage of history. We do not want to assimilate. We have something to contribute to ourselves and to all of humanity. This is the essence of Judaism and the national liberation movement called Zionism. There is a prohibition on marriage as it is written: """" And you shall not marry them. Thou shalt not give thy son to his son, nor his daughter shalt thou take unto thy son, for he will take away thy son from after me, and they shall serve other gods. And our sages interpreted the verse as the words of Rash """" 10, """" We have learned that the son of your next daughter from the Hittite is called your son, but the son of your son who comes from the Hittite, is not called your son but her son, for it is not said of his daughter: Your son """". Thus arose the halachah according to which the son of a Jewish mother is a Jew, even his father is not a Jew, not the other way around. Will this be called racism? - The unclean racism for which one drop of Jewish blood was enough to lead the man in which it flows to a place from which there is no return, while Jewish law says: If the mother is Jewish, there is not even assurance that the father is Jewish, there is even assurance that the father is not Jewish. Were it not for this prohibition and if it were not for this law, who would face the disappearance and problem of existence throughout the Diaspora? What do certain people want, that the Jewish state that has risen to the Jewish people in sacrifices and torments and human and non-human efforts, from the Jewish state will come the news that intermarriage has no prohibition and no obstacle? Most of them will be assimilated like everyone else. For several generations this nation may disappear. Go to Scandinavia and see what is left of the Jewish settlements there as a result of intermarriage. Soon there will be nothing left but a memory of them in a synagogue that still exists on its own. .... """" And as for the Jew - and this I knew - there is no separation between nationality and religion, then in terms of religion and nationality alike the answer as to who is a Jew is determined and will be determined by halakhah, there are people who when they hear the word ""halakhah"" come out of their mouths or From the mouths of others, they demand that all hearers fall down to the ground, stand up and be beaten for sin. This is a reaction - they say - these are light rebels, bearers of darkness, will not come in the advanced crowd, certainly not in the next world, not even in this world. I'm sorry, I'm not shivering and I'm not shocked. What because you have dealt with this law, what because we have hung on it, what because you will despise and what because you will humiliate? This halakhah by which eternal life was planted within us, this halakhah that sustained us in tests of blood and fire and divorces and wanderings. There are those who swear and do not hesitate to say that Jewish law is racist, and that it is reminiscent of Nazism. Woe to the ears that hear this. In the days when all our enemies in the soul call for the liberation of our country """" Nazi occupation """": In the days when those who signed the agreement with Nazism and opened the trenches of evil before World War II, call us unclean, our people come to our country and cast such blemishes on our people for generations. What do these people want, that our children should be ashamed of being born Jews? What do they want, that it is said that we must flee from the heritage of our ancestors to be decent people and not Nazis and not racists? Jewish law, which has existed for thousands of years, is racist, and a self-respecting person will run away from it. Did we come here to be ashamed of our Judaism, of our forefathers, or to continue their legacy? How can a person in Israel not compare the ""Jew"" ""listed on the ID card and the"" Larry ""register among the unclean among them? Is Jewish law racist? Since the plot of a blood libel against this people, it has not been more terrible than the one that originated in a self-plot. Racism hates foreignness and migration, and Jewish law? The term """" lived """" has two meanings, and so they have evolved over the generations. What does the law say? """" Makes an orphan and widow sentence and loves to give him bread and a dress. And you loved Hagar, because you lived in the land of Egypt. And you will not live and we will not press, because you lived in the land of Egypt. "" With almost every verse like this, the command and the commandment are repeated, because you lived in the land of Egypt. Where will you find a higher anti-racist morality than this? """". """,1

"Mr. President, your position against incitement and in favor of freedom of expression in its place at the right time when the people need direction and a way that is not self-evident due to the bitter experience of the incumbent government. But, unfortunately, you fall into the trap and hope you make a mistake. You ended your remarks with a blessing for a couple, which is actually a blessing for assimilation and a wink to Islamization. As you do not go out and greet every Jewish couple who marries, you should not have greeted this couple. You said your respectful opinion, and in doing so you did your job exemplary ... and in this case there is no ""everything is fine"" ""... but quite the opposite.""",1

Some screamed out of human strife and called for missiles to be sent to the center of the country and IDF for all killed and wounded of our soldiers. In this war, we have repeatedly encountered infidelity of Israeli Arabs to the country in which they live and exist. Most Palestinians do not even call themselves a concept called Palestine. , And all the Arab MKs who declare their hatred of Israel and their identification with the Palestinian people. When and if the Israeli Arabs prove loyalty to Israel, their country of residence, among other things, tolerance will arise and racism will fade.",1

"Mr. Rivlin who noticed, how she became a healer of the soul, straight you blame the Jews, what she wrote, an Arab actor will not be humiliated, the Jews did not mention that the Jews are always humiliated in their country too, they must not raise their heads, some Jews are murdered by Arabs, you heard about the girl Shelly Dadon who murdered her Arab drove a taxi, just because she is Jewish, heard about maybe the three boys who were killed because they were Jews, and because you and a policewoman prevented the death penalty for terrorists wanted to release their terrorist brothers in prison, today two returning students murdered by a Palestinian Arab, one was run over Of the tractor in Jerusalem, and the other in the Jerusalem forest, but with you Mr. Rivlin, Shimon's twin, racism is only with the Jews, no wonder Mr. Netanyahu did not want you for the job, how everyone replaces your skin like a chameleon, only you come to power, including your teacher Begin , Destroying the city of Yamit, and the land of our ancestors Sinai gave to the murderer of Sadat and entangled us in a terrible war in Lebanon, and gave the High Court to Aaron Barak, the Ashpist, there is a verse in the Torah that says your destroyer and your haters came out of you.",1

He will rest on his bed in peace.,0
"Mr. President, do you know that the Jew converted to Islam to get married? What incitement are you talking about? Congratulations to the Jews who are fighting for the preservation of the people of Israel! Are you also affected by the media that has recently taken a hit on a few right-wingers who may have behaved riotously in some demonstration by leftists, inciting against anyone who loves and defends Israel and presents them as violent people?",1

"Honorable President, For two days we have been trying to locate you and Ms. Emily few so that you can come and listen to the cries of asylum seekers for freedom and basic respect as human beings. For two weeks, asylum seekers waged a quiet and appreciative struggle at the Holot detention facility (a word washed to the detention camp) on Friday and in desperation turned to the border with Egypt on foot - they were repulsed by police and army forces. So far, the refugees have been in perfect order near the Nitzana border crossing - About 700 asylum seekers. The State of Israel, the state of the people of the Holocaust refugees vehemently refuses to recognize asylum seekers and refugees - from Sudan and Eritrea. Where is the moral right of the State of Israel? Today they tried to evacuate them using tear gas and violence - this is the true face of Israel. And immoral https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10152590641027578&set=pcb.10152590656122578&type=1&theater",2

Love you Ruby! Congratulations !,0
"Honorable President No one has incited or threatened to accuse an entire public of incitement just because his right-wing views are already racism against the right .. and the most painful thing is that it comes from a right-wing man .. The public protests against marriage right we live in a democracy but I want to ask the honorable president Will his family allow his sister to marry a Jewish man? No, she will kill on the grounds of family honor ... and most girls who marry minorities suffer and a Yad Laachim organization saves them from the atrocities they go through in Morel's case. They try to save her another Jewish soul ... But the easiest and most requested is to accuse the right as usual and interesting that the left is enlightened then His Majesty that all the enlightened will give their daughters to minorities for the wedding we will see them",1

Justice has come out! The only man who can restore the almost lost dignity of the institution of the presidency. Ruby Yakirnan. Ruby the man who opens every conversation with him in the word Jerusalem. Ruby is the man most deserving of the high office. You do not have to prove anything to anyone. Leave as you are.,0
What does it matter that Morel is stationed with Mahmoud ??? What's the matter with anyone? What also decided you have ownership of who should marry whom ??,0

Not worth the salary he gets",1
Amen yes there will be a will,0

The name will bleed,1
"Well done for taking a stand on the issue while all politicians are silent. We live in a democratic society, and must strive for a tolerant and tolerant atmosphere. Everyone is allowed to oppose and express an opinion, but by no means to resort to violence, incitement and racism just because not everyone thinks and acts the same way.",0

Shame just shame. Infidelity in the Torah of Israel. You have no right to be the president of the Jewish state if you say things that are the complete opposite of what the Torah says. I do not owe it to the honor of any daughter of Israel who went to flirt with an Arab. If it had been in the time of our ancestors long ago they would have stoned it. I suggest that instead of starting your path as president putting a stripe on the Bible and Judaism take your stuff and retire.,1
It reminds me of the sketch in which Robbie Rivlin participated,0
"Dear Rivlin, Your words are appreciated, but not enough ... The Land of Israel has always been a place where you can express your views openly, unfortunately lately, there is real fear and terror among citizens, fear of expressing our opinions, or living according to our beliefs, fear that characterizes totalitarian states, From which our relatives fled two generations ago. The attack on a couple who wants to get married, as in any democratic country, is a sign of a broader and more worrying phenomenon that reads here. There are organizations that work here, and cast terror and terror beyond condemnation. It is time to act ... to prosecute anyone who threatens, silences, silences ... prosecute Anyone who acts and personally attacks bodies and places just because of their political opinion. It's probably just a barren appeal that you will not even read ... but it's a desperate call from a citizen, once our threat was external, for the first time I feel threatened by the citizens of my country ...",0
"A group of fools and blind people quickly forget what the Arabs are doing to us. Terrorist violence, missiles, why you do not convert to Islam, disgust of sub-level supporters and the president, like everyone who reaches the rank, becomes a leftist, a traitor and a traitor to Israel.",1
Ruby Shavuot is neither a ceremony nor a lasagna is the giving of Torah which is all your essence and the essence of your wife and the essence of your granddaughter and the essence of the people of Israel and the essence of the whole world and Allah what president is we going to have no meaning in his life Torah you did not notice For most weeks this lasagna tell me who is your president and tell you that our country is shallow in its leaders and bankrupt in its values ??is that what the president of the state has to say about the giving of Torah? I'm ashamed,1
President worthy of office,0
Respect for the President. It's important to say that maybe it will restrain those who have decided to impose their stamp on people and their choices. Who appointed them to maintain racial purity? It has no place in a democratic state nor in a Jewish state. Tolerance and respect is the name of the game.,0

"There is hunger in Israel. There is abundance in Israel. Nothing is missing. And at cheap prices. But the price that citizens get triples and quadruples themselves in networks. Brokerage gaps are growing and growing by hundreds of percent. And the lust for pigs is only rising. Once upon a time a hungry child would express himself in terrible thinness. Today hunger does not come in the form of thinness. Some children are not thin but they are hungry: they eat only what is cheap. Only the garbage that exists in the market because of the economic returns in Israel. Eat only bread in the family. Because there is no money for vegetables and fruits that are priced in pig and overpriced chains. That's why you do not see the hungry child on the street. It is the transparent Western hunger. There is an excess of healthy food like vegetables and fruits and more ... but there are those who pull the strings for pigs for greed. There is no government policy on this issue. This is the government's betrayal of the citizen. Access to food is a political question. And the government has the ability to change economic policy but it is not interested. And the government even encourages with the help of laws non-compete, centralization to the point of bullying of a limited number of people who control the food market:. The film raises the bar above the continuing denial of the hunger phenomenon in Israel, which has begun to gain momentum in the last decade, mainly due to the massive and continuing rise in prices of most basic food products, and examines the effects of the phenomenon on health. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxRJZkDMFx8 Vacuum Season 3: Western Hunger in the State of Israel More and more people are eating what they can afford and not what they need ....",2

"I have a request for the President of the State of Israel, Reuven Rivlin: - The Honorable President, it is time to pardon Legal Amir, a time to forgive a terrible offense committed by a fatal mistake. We need a time when we will discover true humane wisdom and compassion. This is a person who acted maliciously. The man was an IDF officer, he was a loyal citizen of the state. An offense he committed - while worried about the future of a state. Not while hating a person. He paid a heavy price for an offense he committed. He paid 20 years. Some people take advantage of every circumstance to abuse a Jew. Asks that we no longer be dragged after extremist people who act for political and malicious reasons; it is simply enough to continue torturing a pointless person. We will show great, wise and compassionate. Asks President Reuven Rivlin to pardon Yigal Amir. Let us discover and humanity. Let him live. Thank you very much State of Israel Rivlin.",0
Honorable President a lot of success in the new position. This page should be updated to the official page of the President of the State and not of a Member of Knesset,0
The heart is torn..what a sweet child the heart hurts! May Gd send strength and mental strength to His parents who will somehow succeed in rising from this tragedy and the hallucinatory reality that befell them in the middle of life.,0
Everyone who speaks language about assimilation - even at the wedding of a Jewish guy and a British girl do you want to demonstrate? Because there are hundreds of them every year. If not - no assimilation and no shoes. Just racism.,0

"Dear Ruby, I very much hope that common sense will enter the Knesset members, especially the ultra-Orthodox, and the religious, because there is no other suitable person besides our Ruby. He is an honest, trustworthy, smart, Jewish man with a great soul. Loves the people and the land and Jerusalem. Shitrit is just a traitor who betrays the Likud and Kadima and becomes Tzipora's carpet. All the traitors went to Kadima including the disgusting and repulsive Dalia Itzik. Garbage from the trash can. She and Fouad. And Shitrit forgot that he exploited the Likud functionaries for other purposes. Such garbage God forbid he should be president. Only such a traitor we need. Besides, seven years of suffering that we the people suffer from the outgoing president Peres. Shmalan.dumb. He is responsible for the disasters that befell us from the Oslo Accords. And with all his impudence he continued to compel the whole people to accept his stupid opinions. A real shame. Celebrations made for himself. He spent state money endlessly and no one checks it. ??? It's interesting. We'm tired of President Shmulan.",0
"Honorable President of the State of Israel, it is time to take off our white gloves. The Israeli government will need a hard and decisive appropriate response, for the sake of being seen.",1

Dear President Good luck to you,0
The president showed nobility of soul when he arrived at the funeral and proved that there is a president in Jerusalem who cares about the residents of the envelope and the periphery ...,0
"In the name of ""democracy"" you and the Shmuelans are destroying our country giving legitimacy to assimilate, freedom of expression for Arabs in the Knesset to say that our army commits war crimes, supporting terrorists, the police arresting a woman waving the Israeli flag in Rabin Square in front of a leftist demonstration supporting terrorism. That Hitler failed to exterminate the people of Israel, we do to ourselves with assimilation !!!!",1
"Yes, it is very important that we Jews behave respectfully and love Arabs. But when will they love us? When will we stop murdering in the streets when? When will Abu Mazen, the leaders of Hamas, Arab countries, register on their Facebook for their people: Enough, stop hating, stop killing, it's not nice ... When? Never !",1

"To the previous seven backers: Democracy does not mean erasing personal opinion nor as president. Even if the state includes minorities of Arabs (98% of them Muslims) and Christians and Muslims (in Israel they are all Arabs) the president of the Jewish people must not and should not bless a marriage between an Arab and a persistent Jew, marriages that harm Jewish identity and bring assimilation into the Jewish state. And even if Ruby himself opposes, to greet such is a blessing for assimilation and damage to Jewish identity.",1

"I'm just stunned by what I call the Honorable President You probably have not seen the horrific and creepy Yad Laachim films about Jewish girls who married Arabs. Please do your homework before you greet them because the joy will be with the Arabs only that another Jewish girl has fallen in captivity With the family of her new husband and with his subsequent wives he has no more people, and in our Torah it is written and you will not marry them your daughter will not give to your son and you will not take his daughter to your son. For he will remove your son from after me and serve other gods, and the Lord will be angry with you and destroy you from the mountain. In this instruction stepping on others, there is here only an instruction for this group that will continue to maintain itself so that this group will not be lost from the world. Because the global purpose for which the people of Israel exist is an eternal goal, it must be ensured that this people will continue to exist forever and ever, and the first element to ensure this is to preserve identity through the prevention of assimilation.",1
"Long live the President of the State of Israel, Ruby Ravlin. Please do not be spoiled, always remain loyal to the people of Israel and the State of Israel.",0
I'm right sorry I meant on behalf of the sane Jews that it is important to them that Judaism is preserved if you are hurt I apologize (all cynically) now seriously ya left ended with a lot of people I promise you you can read comments that many think like me and only the sane and doubtful Jews think like you ..,1
Here are some such reactions I feared from President Rivlin it is called a Jew with feelings of inferiority,1
"I have a dream that games that take place in Sakhnin will be free of terrorists waving wizard flags. I have a dream that politicians in Israel will begin to represent the people of Israel and stop beautifying themselves in order to remember the pages of their imagination. I have a dream that the people of Israel and the loyal citizens of the State of Israel will receive more. I have a dream that the loyal minorities will get bigger options than the unfaithful minorities, such as an MK from the Bled traitor factions, etc., I have a dream that the traitors and terrorists will be executed after their guilt is proven. And I have many more good dreams of your own dear and honorable president. Push the poor Arab and start treating everyone as residents of the country",1
Shame on you for being my president. I thought you had a little more respect and affinity for the Jewish heritage.,1
good luck !,0
Congratulations to the people of Israel that the tenth president elected is Reuven Rivlin ... Respect and appreciation for this person. Good luck Mr. President!,0
A good start !!!,0

"The President of the State of Israel - the State of the Jews, is very dear to us. I am sorry to have disappointed you with your intervention in the matter of assimilation contrary to Judaism and the Torah. As an individual, you were able to say what was in your heart, but in your lofty position you were misled by judgment and it is a pity ...",1
Charming ??,0
"We did not wait for such a president and the prayers. This marriage causes assimilation and if that is the case in Israel, then God forbid we will reach the percentage of assimilation as abroad (50% -60%)",1
How can there not be a year of drought and for 47 years we have not declared any war or operation when this zero president encourages assimilation and plays it liberal and the son of the prime minister comes out with a gentile woe to us from the day of judgment woe to us from the day of rebuke check history every time we abandoned the way we got hit Painfully it says in the Pillar of Fire that 60 percent of European Jewry were assimilated and look what a terrible Holocaust they went through compared to the Torah keepers in Eastern Jewry we have a short memory you will wake up,1
Daniel so honored,2
Great President Ruby ....,0
Luckily no one is really listening to the presidency,1
"You will also condemn the racism of the Arabs. The fact that the state prefers to conceal the death cries for Jews who are accompanied by deeds is not right. To say the least . Only when both sides work to lower the level of physical and verbal violence will it work. I am against violence of any kind, but I am tired of facing only the Jewish side.",1
I'm in shocked market No one will be able to get into Mr. Shimon Peres' shoes and Rivlin You are very disappointing,1
Whoever cooks the porridge will eat it at the end for better or worse. Those whose opinion differed from hers did theirs with good intentions only. Prevention of assimilation and previous experience of women who found themselves in a different reality than they had expected in the first place.,1
"Dear President, Thank you very much every time again!",0
Honorable President. Even your strange visit to Deri's house will not in any way damage my love and admiration for you. In appreciation.,0

""We all feel sorry for them. What do we have no heart for?) Mr. President, you better not refer at all. If it comes close to being a norm, from"" ""Jewish Democratic"" ""in the end will remain only democratic ""A state for all the peoples.

Continue - especially today after the affair of Meir Sheetrit became known.,0
The right thing to do was to avoid expressing your opinion about intermarriage. You do not always have to respond and keep your details private. Do not forget that you now represent an entire country.,1
"The heart is in tears. And to you, Mr. President, I express my appreciation for your participation in the funeral of this lovely child.",0
And why not also show the voice of the father of the bride in heartbreak pleading that his house will not be assimilated? This is racism that shows only one side of the coin!,1
You were wrong and big time!,1

"Ruby ... our brother and our beloved president ... to remind you ... the destiny of the people of Israel is to serve as a light to the Gentiles .... On the one hand the people of Israel claim that they have ancestral rights, that the land of Israel belongs to the people of Israel according to the Torah of Moses, It has not yet fulfilled its destiny ... and according to the Torah of Moshe Rabbeinu, the condition for the existence of the people of Israel is the existence of the rule ... and love for your neighbor as yourself .... and as we know, a rule must be included from all the details that are called rules, and if one detail is missing. .. there is no existence at all .... In order to serve as a light to the Gentiles we must first discover the light within us ... for how can we serve as a tool that distributes light without the revelation of the light within us?",1

"I wish this year would inspire us to have the courage to liberate and liberate also a land department for our neighbors, who will open their country in it and we will win our country within defined borders. Let us be satisfied with the part and not the whole I have deceived that will bring us joy and redemption. May we have the powers of the soul to drop from us some of what is considered in our eyes the complete necessity for our physical and spiritual existence ... that we may succeed in believing in happiness and tranquility that do not depend on matter but on the spirit that continues to be connected to every chosen place ...",1
"I really like your message, it should become a dream of all of us.",0
Ruby is no more deserving than you !!. How amazing it will be if and when in the rest of Jerusalem you lift a trophy and you are there. rise and succeed .,0
"Occupied by our very dear President, and very honorable, very much loves what you have written. Glad you're our president. And really a sad day for the destruction of our two temples. And now most of all about the death of our very dear soldiers. I very much hope that their deaths will not be just like that. And a victory must be achieved on the issue of terrorist organizations. wish you luck . And I was very glad to see you at Mr. Jabotinsky's memorial.",0
"Dear Ruby, worthy worthy worthy .....",0
"disgrace !! Why are right-wing leaders always eager to apologize and bow to all the oppressors of Israel in the antisemitic world ?! http://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-4557848,00.html",1
"The evening before sunset begins the fast of Tisha B'Av which for all generations has been between the days of destruction of the Temple, difficult days of war and also the destruction of Gush Katif and other troubles. A few laws to apply and remember if you see the temple go down immediately the name stops fasting and go out for celebrations. Until then mourning until the end of the fast ...",1
I never thought in my life that the President of the State of Israel would support assimilation. Today I am ashamed of the institution of the presidency. I prefer Katsav to you.,1
"Mr. President Good luck in the job, I tell you that you are two drops like my older brother !!",0

Long live long live the President of the State of Israel.,0
Everything that happens is always for the better !!!!,0
"Well done . I read here full of horrible reactions, and it seems that most people in this country do not really understand what it is to be a Jew .. how much respect, appreciation and love there is towards living in Judaism, but the Jews probably do not understand it ... strange .. OO",0
What a sweet ... Happy holiday to the next President of the State of Israel. We love you and support you until victory!,0
Rivlin Disappointment does not surprise you trying to please a pity,1
"Congratulations on attending the funeral, not being afraid, not giving in to the GSS 'fears about your security. Surprise of the year, President of the State. A true leader comes wherever there are citizens who need it. Your way to the prime minister and defense minister who did not bother to come. Shame and disgrace",0
"Ruby did you start with the nonsense ??? It is interesting that the Jewish people are harmed when there is no communication, you do not post .... !!! What has changed this Bible from other cases ????",1
"Khalas with the hypocrisy, we all know what you really think about the subject! Like your predecessors, no one has the courage to say what they really think! By the way, what do you think would have happened if a Jew had taken an Arab for a wife? The opposition from the other side was much more severe and rightly so!",1
"Honorable President, Compassion ??? Blood is the oxygen of these vile murderers ...",1
Also for non-kosher food ... President Alec lol,1
Come on bunch of hypocrites,1
Hard to digest. May his memory be blessed,0
"Well done to the President of us all. The right of every person in a democratic state to act as he sees fit as long as he does not harm the foundations of the state. To all those ""concerned"" about harming the Jewish people, I suggest joining me and coming out against the religious Orthodoxy that prevents those who want to be loyal citizens and fulfill their dream. This is a large population of immigrants from the former Soviet Union who are making their lives bitter in their Jewish identity. """,0
"If the situation were reversed, an Israeli Muslim would be interested in marrying a Jewish mother if there was consent from the Muslim sector in the country. definitely not .",1
Straighten up the power of a dear man.,0

Lots of success there is nothing to be disappointed you have done above and beyond and you are a highly valued person believe me you just won.,0

You are a favorite of the salt of the earth still left. Leader. Can I be your assistant?,0
"Mr. Rivlin. You are not a technocrat. You are a person with a heart that is able to contain an entire people within it. I am happy with your choice. A worthy sequel - albeit a different one - for Shimon Peres. Since you have seven years of service, do not waste all your energies, in our country, life is dynamic, self-storage of energy is needed for the future.",0
"Sensitive, not emotional. Please fix!",1
Huge congratulations to the President of my country,0

Ruby you are a brother,0
"Levana Ben Itzchak, really all day I listened to the news and did not understand why they are deprived of the basic right that should stand for every person. The right to exercise their desire to leave a country that treats them so badly. To be sure, there are plenty of countries in the world where you can seek asylum if you want to escape from a racist and immoral country like our tiny country. And from you no one will prevent it.",2
Shabbat Shalom,0
"Thank you, Mr. President, for illuminating a dark corner of our lives, thank you for working for unity within the people !!! Good luck on your way !!",0
By the way the groom is a drug dealer and convicted,2

Fake in a big way Mr. Ruby Rivlin with Israel Chai,1
What nonsense then let's bury the values ??and the Jewish state in the name of armed democracy okay? What all of a sudden became enlightened educated and smart ??? Have you forgotten anything and do not know that Jews will be everywhere you go? After all that our people have been through the painful history and anti-Semitism that celebrates me it does not necessarily bother morale but the general idea that people have forgotten how our grandparents fought fiercely to preserve their Judaism precisely here in the Jewish state it became legitimate and a matter of name,1
You will take a walk Do not worry Love you and you deserve to be President of the State of Israel and believe that you will be among the first to take care of nothing real and the citizens of Israel .... One thing you will promise once you open a department to contact you and do everything to change this miserable situation. In the history of the Jewish people who did good things. For every problem of the public this is the request .... in all this even if you do not agree you will be my president that my first priority and my dream and if not Dorner I will let you know that you are winning,0
A lot of pleasure from the grandchildren ...,0
Guy sleeping with your dad naked until age 17 is also violence.,2
That your granddaughter will marry Erdogan's grandson a piece of trash can we Jews will love !!!!,1
"Elected President of the Jewish People Calling for Assimilation of Racism? We were a little confused. What is a lunatic asylum here? Rabbi Nachman says a person who does not live in holiness receives the stupidity of the mind and heart and no longer distinguishes between good and evil! A just protest against the daughter of Israel who chose to marry an Arab honorary president! Our haters are our great enemy these with the missiles .... and their silent and destructive war is to steal the minds of the daughters of Israel and marry them in order to destroy the Jewish people already 40,000 Jewish women have lost their way and are married to Arabs and not shout ??? How long will the Lord of the Worlds keep your children asleep standing up! 70-80 years and soon gas and flying, everyone's doomsday will come ... what will you say? Honorable President ""No! I did not just want us to respect each other?. Freedom of expression"" "".. Evacuation !!! ... Demonstrations is not a place where you will find me there, but where there is blasphemy I will respond!""",1
That a 4-year-old child pays the price of a war .... it dismantled me ?? quite want to grow up quietly ...,1

I think that over-intervention in the couple's wedding reinforces the phenomenon of assimilation because it is the most publicized wedding in the world.,1
"Indeed, as you mentioned, ""not everyone must rejoice in the joy of Mahmoud and Morel - but everyone must in their honor."" There is no doubt that the issue is complex, but why does the far right and others in the country not oppose quite a few Jewish women marrying foreign football players? """,1
That your granddaughter will marry Erdogan's grandson a piece of trash can we Jews will love !!!!,1

Good thing you woke up ...,0
"Artist that the dream will come true, Shabbat Shalom Honorable President ..",0
"Shoshana, personal opinions are nice. In a country whose citizens are Jews, Christians and Muslims, the president of the state must be the president of the whole state and not just of the Jews - sometimes even contrary to his personal opinion. It's the price of democracy and your ability to write whatever you want ... a man of his faith. Shabbat Shalom",0
How painful !!!,0
so sad,0
My next president is ours,0
Ruby it seems to me that you accidentally sat down on the presidential chair because in my opinion you should have sat down on the prime minister's chair.,1
Especially the left ...,0
"It is good that there are Arabs who respect you, Your Honor, it is a pity that we did not see them in demonstrations in favor of Israel !!!!! And quite a few Arabs have cooperated and are cooperating against the State of Israel, only this must not be forgotten !!!! And I say everything here gently !!!!!!!!",1
You're not my president. Whoever is elected by the votes of the left and the Arabs is a traitor.,1
It reminds me a bit of a plan you harassed your friend there hahahahahahahahahahahaha with pictures of your grandchildren!,0
May they return in peace - we all pray and strengthen the hands of the families - Amen,0

Year. (Maybe) """,1
The heart refuses to accept the lessons of small flowers that did not have time to bloom and rejoice. May his memory be blessed with a precious and special soul. My heart is torn,0
This is true love,0
"As a son of the president, why express an opinion, the father asks begging for his soul that his daughter will not marry a gentile, does not want Muslim grandchildren, what freedom or racism are you talking about ???",1
"And what about the condemnation of Israeli Arabs who demonstrated and incited violence during the war? In Kafr Qassem, fireworks were fired as a sign of joy as the missiles threatened our heads, and the muezzin read whole nights and disturbed the peace of the nearby Jewish settlements. Condemn them, relax from us already, and do not be beautiful, Mr. President.",1

I wish I had the opportunity to meet Martin on the King website. An amazing and brave person,0
A free people in our land. The reference is to Jews only to Jews because what we have passed through for generations is that both Christians and Arabs murdered us. This is the meaning that we have a state from the Holy Blessed is the Holy Land. And we will not assimilate only a state to Jews. He who is not a Jew will do what he pleases. Therefore we see the hatred for us in the world why? Because you are a stupid president and do not understand that the Shechinah will not be here until there are those who do not need it. From the Jebusites. The Hittites.,1
"Nothing less done more Take an example from Regev converters from Bennett or Ben Ari !! As President, I would expect you to work to eradicate Israel's enemies like Hanin Zoabi. But it probably will not happen because most of you in the Knesset all you care about is sitting on the chair for a long time",1

"Dear Rubik, Congratulations to you and your granddaughters, a pleasant and safe freedom. My heart aches for the humiliating murder of the three boys.",0
"It is a pity that they do not really look at the nature of the problem and it is a pity that our leaders wherever they are are always busy showing how seemingly enlightened we are. This is not racism. There are a lot of problems here in this matter. If children are born to her on the one hand according to Islam, they will be considered Muslims according to which they follow the father's religion, while according to Judaism who follow the mother, they will be considered Jews. Where is the matter of holidays, traditions, etc.? Where is the matter that the children will reach 120 where they will have to be buried, is it in a Muslim or Jewish cemetery? I want to see that there are such Arabs who were willing for their daughter to marry a Jew and if there is a drop in the ocean, they will be able to murder her for the honor of the family, and there have never been cases. Not to mention that from the experience of girls who went with minorities only shit came out of this story, starting with the humiliating blows from the family members. A lot of girls got into relationships with members of minorities who did not know in the first place that they were members of minorities or seduced girls from difficult families day in and day out with money. I do not think this is a good start to a relationship.",1
"Gd created man and the Jew separated from the Gentile and therefore whoever wants to protest against the scoundrel who will be today will protest forcefully and without violence. What is certain is the honor of the president who in a short time will hear about the violence that will be directed against morale from this Mahmoud is only a matter of time. If we do not take care of the fate of our sons and daughters in our country, we will be just like the number of assimilated Jews in the United States. Democracy also has limits and the limit is to dissuade and convert our sons and daughters from their religion.",1

The president has not said anything about for or against this marriage and he is right because that is not what matters at the moment. He speaks of human dignity and liberty and tries to prevent extremists of all kinds from engaging in violence and which sow hatred and incitement in a disturbing manner. Align the Honorable President!,0

You will be ashamed to encourage assimilation in a country we have dreamed of for years. Ugh.,1
HiD,1
May this modesty - which the people so long for - continue!,0
Long live our president.,0
Well done to the President who works for tolerance in the country. One should not let go and keep acting until the dream comes true! It depends only on us.,0
Assimilation Honorable President I am sorry to hear your opinions and you who came out of a family of rabbis give a hand to speak instead of condemning it without violence,1
"Honorable President, you are an inspiration!",0
"You gave too much to this girl, there is nothing to do anymore, she converted to Islam and in that she closed the story. Do not forget friends who had a good teacher at home - a mother with an Arab, a nurse with an Arab and whatnot.",1
Lots of success - a worthy contender and the right choice for the people!,0
We have the president of Manesh,0
To all those who support this wedding first thing I do not wish them but the statistics say that all the Arabs who married Jews after the wedding the bride was beaten and became a slave of the groom and his whole family second thing and here I am asking the question no one has asked yet if a Jew Was marrying an Arab this wedding would also have taken place? Understand the Arabs and of course not all but the vast majority want to destroy the Jewish people so they have many ways it is also terrorism and among other things to take our daughters to Islam them and marry them hope you will understand what many girls realized too late,1
Honorable President Mr. Reuven Ruby Rivlin to this day I have held you as a simple and humble person pleasant walks from today you are not a friend where your compassion Dad torn in heartbreaking cries that his daughter assimilated and converted to another father That he has no father: '(I feel sorry for this father I am waiting for this moment that she will betray him against the background of the honor of the family and I made my considerations Honorable President Mr. Reuven Ruby Rivlin from today you are not a member ... https://www.facebook.com /photo.php?fbid=10200254294559743&set=t.100001740175804&type=1&theater,1

"And with all due respect, the Israeli Arabs are proving at every opportunity that they are the enemies of the Zionist entity in the State of Israel, despite the recognition of them as equal citizens (without obligations). I have not heard any of them speak in praise of Israel or condemn aggression against Israel or turn out to be an Israel fan ... In his name and we will come out of the illusion of ""coexistence"" because they prove time and time again to whom they belong with whom they identify and how much they hate us ... regardless of what they get from us. The difference between us and them is that we sanctify every person as a person and they hate a Jew as a person. So I very much respect the opinion of the President of the State who is the President of the State of all its citizens. The only question to be asked is what are the criteria for true citizenship and loyalty to the homeland. """,1
Strong and blessed honor the President,0
Happy holiday !!,0
"Honorable President, it is good that you maintain your dignity and stay away from all the delusional left",1

Congratulations and good luck. Love you and are proud. The Grundman family,0
Congratulations on the leaf and the success,0
Despicable as you are - and that includes you Rivlin. All you are interested in is one word - racism. What about the father's feelings? What about all those women who fell victim to the new terror: https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?v=274188336112130&set=vb.270716683125962&type=2&theater,1

"Honorable President, this is racist anti-Semitism towards the Jews. Goebbels style from the Germany of the 1930s will come back to you and immediately we are not racists. Opposition to assimilation is not racism! And is not an ardent property of the ""extreme right"" ""is a basic thing in Judaism and commands us to fight the phenomenon of racism is the doctrine of race with Israel we do not talk about this race about spirituality and allow man faded to join and not kill anyone if not! And this is in stark contrast to Islam. And shed our blood! """,1
Sad sad sad,0
Go to hell you too what are you looking for to be liberal at the expense of Judaism that is becoming more and more biased with people like you,1
It's hard to see the picture and believe that this beautification is gone,0
Ruby Mr. President Hashem will succeed your way and all your deeds. A Zionist Jew is proud of you and your way,0
Your Honor The President All the seemingly racist chants are as a result of the actions and behavior of the Arabs and especially the Israeli Arabs who identify with the enemy. This is what I call self-defense and not racism.,1
I have not heard from you about all the terrorists who are burning my country. But at every opportunity you go out against Jews but there is God in heaven who hears and sees everything ......,1

Did anyone here get a Like from the President?,2
"It's really not pretty all the wishes you wish him here! First of all I believe that his daughters / granddaughters have received a more appropriate education and therefore will not marry someone not from religion. Second thing the girl made a decision and nothing will change her! So enough to think that you can control the world and change the decisions of others, go invest your efforts in better things, instead of wasting time on it. The consequences she will have to deal with later, for better or worse, and that time will tell. So enough! Deal with your own affairs.",0
May his memory be blessed forever,0
The funny thing is that Mr. Rivlin was one of the Ashkenazi nobility of yesteryear that if she had brought an Oriental groom to the house it would have been a disaster. So Arab now he is allowing shame to the Jewish people whose president encourages assimilation Mr. Rivlin I am ashamed of you you are not my president,1
"Finally, someone from Israeli politics gathers courage and goes against the racist chants that have spread in the country, as you promised, you are everyone's president and a true democrat.",0
"For what you say to him thank you for supporting the Gentiles !! I am ashamed that you are my president. There will soon be an Islamic state here, but we will fight for this country.",1
When does a president intervene ??? When did a president intervene in the abusive songs of Hapoel fans ... to the Jews ??,1

I have all the respect and appreciation for you..I have no doubt that there are lovely people everywhere no reaction here on both sides reflects the two societies as there is an extreme minority on both sides there are very many sane and logical people..and please do not need disrespectful reactions from both sides feeling and empathy with people killed Innocent is not called treasonous identification with the huib and against the state ..,1
Sad So sad Thank you for sharing and sensitivity,0
"That the three holy boys were murdered. The State of Israel awoke and the army began operating in the Gaza Strip. After Daniel was killed, the State of Israel changed the way the Gaza Strip was treated. Why do innocent people have to pay with their lives until our leader wakes up. Why not work an hour before?",0
The heart hurts. My heart is with you.,0

I do not understand what is so exciting about this story. They are a couple who have been together for 5 years even she is atlasma because of their love. Who are we to intervene in their lives. Everyone who looks at himself before opening his mouth,1
"What is the problem with the Palestinian flag? To the best of my knowledge, being photographed with the Palestinian flag has long been a violation of the law in the State of Israel. Jews in the Diaspora are photographed in the morning and evening with the Israeli flag and God forbid I have a problem with it on the contrary, but dhilcom already out of the box you are in Palestine call it a state, autonomy, whatever you want but one thing is for sure it is finished and the world including Israel recognizes it exists , So what do you want from citizens who identify with their people who have become legitimate all over the world. And that does not make us at least Israelis, you will already be awakened through the blind hatred leading to doom for us and you.",1
What a small world ! A brother of one of the hostages is studying with me in the yeshiva! Hard to deal with it):,0
You forgot to mention the honor of the president - but not in our school. The State of Israel must not give in to assimilation. And certainly not to encourage. Perhaps this time silence was preferable on the part of His Excellency.,1
We have not yet had a president who plays football. Shabbat Shalom Honorable President Reuven Rivlin,0
A cordial grandfather is sure,0

"Honorable President, belief in equal opportunities and equality still does not mean consent to assimilation, especially when it is used as a weapon by the Muslims against us to humiliate us and defeat us. Those seductive girls receive money from terrorist organizations and the Palestinian Authority to dazzle their eyes with sweets and various gifts, entice them to marry and convert to Islam and abandon their religion, nationality and be surrogates for the birth of more terrorists. This is not a matter of love or exercising a right.",1

"Mr. President, I wish you many years of action and connection between the various sectors of the State of Israel",0
"Good morning, Mr. President of the State of Israel. You can not begin to understand what happiness fell to me when I watched you win the national position in the country. I must tell you first of all, that personally due to the disgust created by your predecessor in the role, despite the much (and in my fake opinion) prestige he has gained around the world, I was in favor of canceling this role. All as long as this period of the last seven years that come to an end is not repeated. I had a moment of apprehension and worry during the second round that faded with reading the results, thank God. As you said, you are a man of the people, you are also a man of Jerusalem, a man of the Land of Israel and above all you are humble, answered and loved. Please, do not pay attention to what the outgoing president will say to you, unless they are on representative issues that you will have to complete with no choice or even reject them outright if necessary. What really stands out to me and probably to many good citizens, is the extravagance and budget extortion of the President's House, which in 2013 stood at over NIS 57 million. In contrast, the Prime Minister's House budget is like a poor man standing in the doorway; And no, I do not underestimate the budget of NIS 6 million a year or more. I have no doubt that here, too, cuts will not harm anyone and certainly not the operation and management of the Prime Minister's House. Do not fund the non-profit organizations and the Peres Center for Peace at the expense of the President's House budget, or the Rabin Center and no other center. This extravagant and wasteful financing comes at the expense of the taxpayer. I hope and especially believe that your modesty will guide your lifestyle in the House of the President and return this house to be as you mentioned a house of the people of Israel. Rise and succeed in your new path !!! ?",1
How much my heart aches with my parents,0
Want revenge hahaha,1

"The culture of ""nearby will be fine"" also in the national sense. History and reality teach us that the Jewish people have a dangerous suicidal tendency to prefer temporary tranquility and temporary economic well-being and momentary enjoyment in the present, while falling asleep, closing their eyes and ignoring warnings about the dangers of the future and when the Jewish people remember it may sometimes be too late. Wise.",1
Blessings and success in whatever you turn up and do all your life! We are proud and believe in you! Long live our President!,0

To all those who support this wedding first thing I do not wish them but the statistics say that all the Arabs who married Jews after the wedding the bride was beaten and became a slave of the groom and his whole family second thing and here I am asking the question no one has asked yet if a Jew Was marrying an Arab this wedding would also have taken place? Understand the Arabs and of course not all but the vast majority want to destroy the Jewish people so they have many ways it is also terrorism and among other things to take our daughters to Islam them and marry them hope you will understand what many girls realized too late,1
Most exciting!,0
Ruby Rivlin You managed to bring out a lot of anger in the people !!!,1

"Do your job, complete idiot !!! Because we are not interested in your personal opinion (do not worry we know you stink you do not have to announce it)",1
If one of your children were to marry an Arab or an Arab woman you would really be supportive. This hypocrisy of any president or Knesset member is simply outrageous and shows the public exactly how fickle the Knesset members are and take care of their interests. If you were a role model and a strong character you would oppose it. Let them hear your true opinions. Or you just would not interfere.,1

"Mr. President, more than ""these expressions gnaw at the foundations of our common life here ..."", gnaws assimilation into the continued existence of the people of Israel. You chose to quote Ze'ev Jabotinsky in things that were not necessarily said in the context of the issue while Jabotinsky felt contempt for the phenomenon of assimilation. """,1
"Mr. President, to this day I have admired you unquestionably, as one who cares about the people of Israel and the Land of Israel and fights against assimilation and today you encourage assimilation within our country !!! I understand that you are the president of the State of Israel and not the ""State of the Jews"", and this worries and lights red lights in the future as we are """" a separate and different people from all peoples """" In this situation the Messiah should probably reach one opinion first. """,1
Honorable President for what did the people of Israel suffer for hundreds and thousands of years in exile and even sacrificed their lives to maintain their separation from the Gentiles and preserve the Jewish people to reach our own state ... Then in the Jewish state a Jewish president calls for assimilation and more in the name of democracy ???? Woe to us that we have such leaders ... and we probably deserve all the beatings and troubles we receive no wonder because of such deeds that God will forgive us an artist ...,1

For the sake of a few more pats on the shoulder from some leftists ... Tapie where did you get Rivlin,1
I guess there are a lot of weddings between Arabs and Jews so why the riots now?,1
The heart is torn and sad,0
Good luck and you have a grandson who loves you. He wants a souvenir grandfather picture.,0
I have a dream that you will return the keys and go and run for the presidency of the Palestinian Authority..you were the pride of Beit Yisrael lovers and became popular in the sector..you have no backbone and your support for assimilation will rise in the presidency..you are ashamed !!,1

Angels cry in the sky The sadness breaks the silence May his memory be blessed Amen,0
You are your own president! Not of any Jew !!!,1
"The dream of the President of Israel among us should be that the kingdom and leadership of the world will return to the Creator of the world and not to clowns from Shabbat flatterers of elections as we have today just before the end of exile and correction of virtue to gain human rank only in the Holy Torah and how do you expect those who rebel in the kingdom of heaven without fear of kingdoms Flesh and blood and not to act violently or as much as they please. Martin Luther King said I have a dream because he looked at his origins and the ancestry and saw that there is a great need that his descendants will not continue to be a people of slaves and dreamed of being a free people equal in his country, but you are a Jew who has already left From the house of slaves by the Creator of the world from Egypt and you were privileged to be included in the chosen people who reigned over all the nations of the world when the Temple existed and all this was taken from us because of the rebels of the kingdom of heaven like you so instead of dreaming of purpose you continue to dream of vanity. You are the one who rushes in your lineage to Rabbi Eliyahu Hagar. The saint describes to you that he would dare to tell a people like you a dream to get to the World Cup instead of bringing Messiah. You can be sure that the Messiah will not be the one to give the trophy to the world champion, he will be the one to give us back the crown worthy of leading the world and he is the creator of the world and not a cult of clowns.",1
In my opinion there was no need to comment,1
And I have another dream. That motor sports will also have a place in the Holy Land as in the rest of the world.,0
Align your power. That you come to the people in difficult moments. This is the greatness of a president.,0
Burying a 4-year-old child is not perceived as tearing to pieces comfort for the family if possible at all ??,0
"It is a great pity that even when the honor of the president writes from the wishes of his / our heart to respect others, even then there are those who answer the president with impudence, in a blatant and belligerent manner! We should start with a matter-of-fact and worthy response from the president, even if we do not agree with them. If so, how will they behave on the pitches?",0
Successfully,0
"Lovely woman, Nehama Rivlin!",0
The president of the Jewish state must not encourage assimilation..this is what his honor does..It is better not to express an opinion..the greatest enemy of the Jewish people is assimilation ..... Good day and think before you express an opinion.,1

"Dear Ruby, Our sport is far from blind to politics. When Arab players play for the national team and refuse to sing the anthem, when fans endlessly curse a player because of his background or color, all the shit also reaches the stadiums and here you enter the picture as president. Uproot it so that we have peace both on the grass and in the stands",0
Just landed,0
"Honorable President, this is racist anti-Semitism towards the Jews. Goebbels style from the Germany of the 1930s will come back to you and immediately we are not racists. Opposition to assimilation is not racism! And is not an ardent property of the ""extreme right"" ""is a basic thing in Judaism and commands us to fight the phenomenon of racism is the doctrine of race with Israel we do not talk about this race about spirituality and allow man faded to join and not kill anyone if not! And this is in stark contrast to Islam. And shed our blood! """,1
Shabbat Shalom and blessed,0
I also have a dream ... that in the Jewish state they will stop ignoring racism towards Jews ... whether in sports or at all,1
"Mr. President, I think that a person in your position and status is expected to condemn the ""exclusion of women"" performed by the commander of the Givati ??Brigade, who canceled the performance of singer Sarit Hadad (after it was already closed as a free performance for soldiers) in favor of a male singer (Moshe Peretz ""In my place, regardless of my lord's.

"It is more worrying and outrageous that you and your peers encourage the assimilation of the daughters of Israel and even wish good luck to the conversion of the daughters of Israel. If you and your peers were silent and said nothing better, I am ashamed that you are the president of the Jewish people. Congratulations Ruby? You know that this is neither incitement nor racism, yes these are two religions one of which forbids assimilation and a great sin on the head of the assimilated on the other hand and on the one hand conversion, the daughter of Israel converted to Islam and that is what the media president has to say, I am ashamed you are my president. disgrace",1

In a few months the Jew will start beating her ... and for every operation with the Palestinians killed she will be cursed and humiliated ... and when she gives birth to more Muhammad and Abdullah and Hussein ... the groom's mother To a disgraced slave ... It is a pity, Mr. President, that instead of looking statistically at the lives of Israelis who spent several years in a marriage prison with Arabs, and how great their patience is and how many are imprisoned because of the children in the middle. You chose to behave and express opinions that you would not stand if your house would bring you some groom Muhammad who lives in the village and gives birth to grandchildren ""Nasrallah Hussein Ahmad and Abu Khalil"". I ask you on behalf of all the sane in the country to return! Remember that you were elected President of Israel ""They are marrying our daughters ideologically to occupy us in the Ministry of the Interior ... Do not bury your head in the sand !!!""",1

Happy holiday to the President and his wife Nehama. The village comes to some of the cities on Shavuot ....,0
It hurts to shout stupid,1
Honorable President Ruby Rivlin - To oppose and protest against assimilation is a democratic right and the fact that the court allowed the demonstration of the Lehavah organization. Since when is a protest considered incitement? Waving the Israeli flag is both a democratic right and an honor. Is incitement against the prime minister in a left-wing demonstration allowed?,1
What will ??? Enough of humanitarianism It is unbearable to live in such a madhouse.,0
What has the rest of Jerusalem got to do with the presidency?,2
"It is very difficult to ask a people, born into racism and an essential part of its existence, to come out of its skin. Empty things just to say, ""We said.""",1

Shame on you !!!,1
And of course special thanks to Orly Dreaman and Goni Tzur Rivlin who helped a lot in the production of the film ...,0
"And something else tiny and no one will tell me demagoguery. Mr. President, if your granddaughter *** God forbid and God bless you were in such a situation and would like to marry an Arab, would you express yourself like that even then? We all know the truth so why when it comes to other people do you try to show ""enlightened and liberal"" ""about the blood of a helpless Jewish family?""",1

""Fulfilled you are not able to represent the Jewish people and condemn in public such a heinous act that a kosher Shabbat Yisrael will be defiled and converted to Islam. Where did we get a president afraid to express his opinion? It is enough for the hypocrisy of the president of the Jewish state to condemn this act and call for the same morale and explain to her that in this way the Jewish people are doomed. She and her children and descendants will be Muslims. And what matters to you is democracy. The expression is incitement according to democracy """,1
Honorable President of the State of Israel - We are happy to have you as our President.,0

Shame !!! Shame that this is the President of the State of Israel !!!! The daughters of Israel are only for the children of Israel! And I'm ashamed that you encourage such assimilation. Apparently the urine of the presidency has gone to your head too much. Hopefully soon you will fall into some corruption / sexual terrace affair or something like that and fly away from our eyes quickly,1

Goodluck tomorrow . I would definitely choose you!,0
Amen,0
I did not know you had a dwarf grandson. exciting,1
Shabbat Shalom ...,0
You as President of the State can demand to make a law against incitement and the Arab-Jewish conflict that makes the media that gets a stage to bring artists and reporters who sow hatred in the people and there is no control over what is allowed and forbidden because there is no definite law against incitement and extremism celebrates the bodies of Arabs and Jews alike,1
"The Jewish people and the Chinese people at about the same age. There are close to a billion and a half Chinese in the world despite the birth control limit. In my opinion the conclusion is pretty clear that assimilation is a fatal blow throughout the ages. This is in addition to all the extermination journeys we have made throughout history, and sent us into exile, and forcibly transferred many Jews to their religion which is also a form of assimilation. Just thinking back on everything we went through is a miracle that there were any Jews left at all. And how can some fools give thanks to God and their fathers who have hardened their souls and have not assimilated until now? Marrying Gentiles and willingly converting to their religion! Only a ignorant Jew who does not understand what gift he received as a Jew was born, despises his Judaism like that",1
Shaike! :),0
You are a responsible and wonderful president !!! ??,0
Congratulations on your choice. I believe you are suitable for the job and rest assured that you will succeed in it,0

Simple and matter-of-fact,0
Good luck dear man right choice and in its place rose and succeeded,0
"Have you forgotten by now what things he said? You judge him just for one thing ?? Coincidentally also in this ""one"" thing ""I totally support him. Because everyone who answered me behaves automatically then I will also explain: he does not support assimilation and neither do I. It is a pity that the girl decided to leave the people and her religion, it really saddens me. But the main thing is that we live in a democracy and every person has his own opinions and desires.The president (I understand) said this on the nose and anger of all the idiots (yes, yes, you have no mind), and all the respect he is man enough to stand up for his principles. To convert to Islam and live with Arabs, its a problem !!! """,1

"According to doctors, he will die in prison, how is a death sentence imposed in Israel? Official murderers are sentenced to a small prison sentence, which is eventually released in the deal, but a Jew who helped the people of Israel is sentenced to death !! This is what will happen to him if he is in prison so explicitly according to a medical opinion",1

"Dear President, understand what you are saying, but read posts posted by B'Tselem that are much more extreme and dangerous, and they are what the police did and what the counselor did. Check how to write criminal letters to bereaved mothers. I wish the treatment of Israelis inside us would be so quick and effective.",1

"If the wedding had been held in America no one would have cared because it factually happens that there are couples involved in the world that we do not even know about. If it's her choice to disrupt her, if she's good or bad it's her problem. And our dear president meant in a great way the dignity of man and his freedom and he further claimed that no matter what his personal opinion is for that matter so if people do not understand the scripture well they will do if they do not respond. ""Sage for Wisdom Silence""",0
No words are heartbreaking at the sight of innocence and life that has not yet begun and ended in merciless cruelty. May they be comforted from heaven and may the name give parents the strength to continue raising their children,0
Well done,0
"Dear President, you have completely lost it. It is not wise to always use the same words and say no to racism nor incitement nor violence. The democratic right of right-wing activists to demonstrate outside the courtroom is the same as the right of Morel and Mahmoud to get married. It is enough to beautify and say all the enlightened and cool words that will sound good. Just because you are a president does not mean that you should support the marriage of a Jew and a Muslim. Both Muslims and Jews are against this marriage and not because of racism but because it goes against the religion and belief of each of the religions. Get out of the movie you have to be stately sometimes a president has to take a stand and not always be the one who says what is ""right"" to say. This post reminds me a bit of the ""world peace"" phenomenon in the Miss Universe pageant. No one incites, and it is the right of every person in a democracy to demonstrate even if it does not go down well with the people. """,0

"Honorable President, did you mention words like ""incitement"", """" racism """", which in my opinion also have no place in Israeli society. But is this really the picture? Incitement? Racism? Or is it an attempt to preserve the identity of the people of Israel and the Holy Torah? Here is a difference between an Arab or a Swede. A Jew or a Jew is not allowed to marry a Gentile. It can be called racism. But whoever says this, certainly has not learned even a little about the people of Israel and its uniqueness and its statement is from narrow vision and ignorance. To the State of Israel and probably also to the people of Israel. If indeed the people of Israel would go in the spirit of the things you said, and marry Gentiles, out of """" living together """", do you think you would be entitled to be president? Was there a Jewish state? The people of Israel """"?

It is better that these negotiations will explode and bomb Gaza from the air for another 30 days but this time we will bomb a moth to beg and not give up !!! Remember that the blood of the fighters is not shed for nothing !!!!!!!!!! Do not shame them and their memory. Do not raise your head to the other terrorist organizations in the area and show them that we are weak on the battlefield and in negotiations. Where is the Israeli deterrence?

Boycott their lands. They knew that Jewish blood was not spilled. It's time to start ordering and in the Knesset you got a respectable job.

You will not have to go through such anguish but to prove yourself wrong. Robbie Rivlin I had a lot more respect for you when you were silent, so maybe it's really better for you to spare us your words of wisdom, even so we all know how unnecessary the presidency in Israel is, so please do not need to create more issues that will just remind us.",1

"The president of the country, who respects the tradition, is wondering about you. For generations we have known, even those who were far from any glimmer of Torah observance and mitzvos, that marriage to a foreigner is a red line. Especially marriage to a son who is an enemy of the Jewish people. With the people of Israel fighting Palestinian terror on a daily basis, it is not appropriate that the president should find it appropriate to welcome an marriage to the enemy.",1

"Honorable President! Please bring things to the attention of the elect! Bialik's vision of rage that still applies today: on the slaughter / saying: Revenge! Such revenge, the revenge of the blood of a little boy, the devil has not yet created the devil - and the blood will fill the abyss! Heaven, ask for mercy on me! If you have a god and a god in your path - and I have not found him - pray with me for me! My heart is dead and there is no more prayer in my lips, and you have already run out of hope - there is no more hope - until - when, until - when, until when? The hangman! He's neck - get up butcher! I have defiled you like a dog, you have a seed with an ax, and the whole land has an itch for me - and we - we are the few! My blood shall be poured out upon thee, and thou shalt be consumed with blood, sucking blood, and sucking upon thy coat, and he shall not be cut off from everlasting, from everlasting to everlasting. And if there is justice - it will happen immediately! But if - after the exterminator under the heavens the righteousness will appear - his throne will be eradicated forever! And in the wicked worlds the heavens will be destroyed; Ye have also gone, ye idols, in this hamsem and in your blood have lived and been cleansed. And cursed be he that saith, Avenge! Such revenge, the revenge of the blood of a little boy, the devil has not yet created the devil - and the blood will fill the abyss! The blood shall flow to the depths of darkness, and shall devour the darkness, and shall devour all the institutions of the land that languish therein.",1
"A president does not always have to say his opinion. His silence would have respected him more. Sorry for the seal you gave them and who knows what a day child. It is a pity that you ignored the fact that if an Arab marries a Jew she is sentenced to death. So what approval did you give to the new couple when a Muslim converted to Judaism and married her? I was very, very, very disappointed ...",1
But you know as if in the State of Israel they can not really get married right? Do you know that in the State of Israel a Jew or a Jew who wants to marry someone who is not a Jew or a Jew must do it abroad? How does this reconcile with our being a free and democratic state?,1

Those leaders do not dare to come out of their hiding place and the wonderful conditions they have, but they scatter the poison to you and incite you. Have you seen what they do to people from Gaza? Have you seen what they do to women in Afghanistan and Iran? You choose to live so you have the opportunity to leave. And certainly not to return here. Shame that you live here, despise everything that is given to you, but think that everything is due to you. Rejoice that soldiers fall in battle? Well, I'm sorry for the wording but with you one goes twenty Are you sanctifying death? We are sanctifying life. Hamas is a murderous terrorist organization whose methods are cruel and disgusting even against the Arab people. Belongs to the Jewish people from generation to generation and will be forever !! The people of Israel live forever in their land. You have no place here even though we try to live with you in coexistence.

"Monday - Peace and blessings in honor of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu: The people of Israel continue to cry ... The left and Oslo criminals (Livni, Lapid, Peres, Barak, Aharonovich, Meretz, Yachimovich, the High Court ...) are seeking a response from the head And not from the belly. The truth that they are one hundred percent right. The reactions from the belly of these criminals with the morbid and deadly slogans that oppose all morality and human reason (restraint is power, peace is made with enemies, we must give them peace gestures to free terrorists ...) Crime, thousands of wounded to this day, thousands of Jews deported in transfer (left allowed), billions of dollars in defense spending, home protection, building walls, healing the sick and wounded, property damage, and released terrorists who continue to murder! And the people of Israel are waiting for the apology of Oslo criminals in vain ... It is definitely time to act from the head, so the people of Israel demand: - You must act from the head and declare convictions in Gaza, Ramallah and other territories occupied by these evil terrorists as enemy and hostile evil for everything, and act accordingly (no more electricity, water, fuel, .. .) And of course to collect billions of dollars of debt from these wicked ones first - you must act from the head and eliminate Hamas from the root includes the leadership, thoroughly thorough, to the last of the killers! Eliminate it means kill (no prisoners), and do not send our planes to destroy scooters, bicycles and empty houses! It is a spit in the face of the people of Israel and a disdain that will cost the Likud their homes dearly (like the release of the terrorists in the last miserable belly reaction)! And if you have to enter Gaza, then you enter Gaza using the Putin method. Give 24 hours for the evildoers to evacuate women and children to Egypt and then cannons and planes, for a week until the tanks enter to evacuate the rubble and scum. - You must act from the head and immediately enact a death penalty law for terrorists or aiding and abetting murder and take care to pass it! - You must act from the head and free the hands of our excellent soldiers from the laws and shackles of the far left organization of the High Court, which endangers them and all the people of Israel, as proven daily! - You must act from the head and liberate the Temple Mount, all areas first and build foam And East Jerusalem. This of course will lower the prices of apartments and bring employment to thousands! - You must act from the head and solemnly inform the Americans not to intervene in the defense of our country and our children, thank you. (They do it in Iraq, Syria, Libya, Egypt which are thousands of miles away from the borders of America, so let me do it inside our country). - You must act from the head and immediately solve Mr. Aharonovitch, Mr. Danino (directly responsible for the default and abduction of our sons) and of course all those responsible within the police and the Ministry of Internal Security. Not only will they not stay in office but consider prosecution for their direct responsibility! Benjamin . The people of Israel cried enough! It is time to act as the Israeli Prime Minister must act! And if you do, BH will succeed! Because this is exactly the policy of the Creator of the world who appointed you as Prime Minister of the people of Israel, as long as you are educated to do and act from the head, and who removed (at best) any prime minister before you (see your predecessors ...) who failed and surrendered To the wicked, and act from the belly and foreign and hostile interests! If it is difficult for you, open the Book of Kings, and the Book of Samuel in the Bible, and understand and learn how a leader with Israel (King David) must act from the head and behave with his enemies around and inside ...",1

All blue), the death penalty for terrorists, the removal of MKs who speak in condemnation of the state and resign from the UN (because after the speech the mothers gave there, we have nothing to look for in this antisemitic organization.

Just not a dahlia,0
"I wish you and the State of Israel great success and who will allow that during your tenure, we will be proud of our leaders and our country and forget the last few months.",0
It is sad to hear that the President of the State ignores the danger of assimilation and encourages assimilation instead of coming with us and protesting the shame.,1
I advocate that a player in the Israeli team should sing the anthem of the Israeli team. And should be committed to hope. Which disqualifies all Arabs. One country is for one people only.,1
You are the president of the country. . You must come out a buffer against intermarriage !!!,1
Robbie Rivlin I despise you!,1
"Definately not . Just as Jews in Britain do not find it difficult to sing ""El Natsur Hamalka"" and in France the ""Marseilles"" and other anthems, there is no reason why an Arab should not sing ""Hatikva"" even though he is the anthem """" Jew """". The national anthem of which he is a citizen, a sign that he does not really want the existence of that country and all the rest are verbal games. """,1

"One woman, a resident of Zarit (a town close to the border in the north), said in Dan Shilon's program that she had heard for a long time that they were digging under the house. When she reported this, they sent her and the rest of the northerners who hear drilling and excavations mostly at night to take sedative pills. She described how she sees in Lebanese territory concrete trucks and heavy construction equipment go under greenhouses and do not see anything built above ground. She tells how her whole house is shaking, objects are moving and falling .. This is just one community among the many residents of the northern border who have been hearing the sounds of excavations for years! I personally heard many testimonies from IDF soldiers who served on the northern border, who heard excavations, reported to their commanders and nothing was done. They were released long ago! What we had with Hamas in Gaza is nothing compared to what awaits us in the north with Hezbollah. People of Israel, wake up! The residents of the north are alone with this threat. Hamas is the son and student of Hezbollah when it comes to methods of warfare and tunnel theory ... The tunnels in the north are much larger and more dangerous. What happens to us? Fear of conflict? Close your eyes ?? If it's quiet there, what's not clear? They are just digging .. The Israeli government is immediately asked to act to protect the northern settlements and locate the tunnels there as well and get out of a working assumption that the tunnels are already below the northern settlements. The lives of the northern residents cannot be abandoned. If they bring these tunnels into motorcycles and vehicles And everywhere in the country. This is a first-class strategic threat to the security of Israeli citizens. The attack must be prevented from the tunnels that can be carried out every day. Their religion without any delay. We must not allow the failure of the Gaza Tunnels to repeat itself and allow them to carry out their plan for Rosh Hashanah, God forbid. I will expand on what has been said, even though the dripping of Hamas launches into the Gaza Strip is to draw our attention to Gaza. Be distracted and not be free to engage in the real threat in the North. This is an ancient tactic of shoplifters who come in pairs. One asks the saleswoman full of questions and the other steals unhindered .. I scared you? I'm scared too! Let's all work together .. there is something to do .. what can be done? **************** * Share this status and it is advisable to add a few words personally from you, it will make your friends pay attention and read what it is much more than a simple sharing * upload more viral statuses of your own. Note that the image is crucial in the chance of the status to catch the surfer's eye and go viral. * If you have photographic evidence of anything, (how the furniture shakes or moves, photography of suspicious excavation sites, your photographic evidence ...) flood the social networks (Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, etc.). * If you want anonymously, write me your testimony in chat and I will put it below the comments to this status. (Anonymously of course). We must not take the issue off the agenda and we must demand a reference from our government. On such an issue the power of each of us may be limited, but we are all together with a tremendous power to bring about a change in priorities. We, the masses, have the power to bring such an issue to the forefront and no longer allow our government to bury its head in the sand. Here is a documentary that aired on Channel 10 five years ago. Momi Bitton, a resident of a northern settlement who heard excavations. Channel 10 brought an acoustics engineer there. He unequivocally checked and determined that they were digging underground. With machines. That was five years ago !! Watch the video. Three minutes. http://news.nana10.co.il/Article/?ArticleID=1072877 The mayor of Kiryat Shmona sent a letter to the defense minister in which he wrote ""From the beginning of the operation, I began to receive inquiries from residents living near the Lebanese border, who claim to hear underground noises.""

"Guys, I recommend not cursing a president anyway. Although the ruby ??will deteriorate but a president. Honorable President, would she have spoken in a beautiful, gentle and evocative language and even encouraged sympathy for him, God forbid, if it were your child or granddaughter ??? These are the judges of souls in the heritage of Israel",1
Ruby since you became president has changed all your principles,1
President worthy of office,0
"The dream of the President of Israel among us should be that the kingdom and leadership of the world will return to the Creator of the world and not to clowns from Shabbat flatterers of elections as we have today just before the end of exile and correction of virtue to gain human rank only in the Holy Torah and how do you expect those who rebel in the kingdom of heaven without fear of kingdoms Flesh and blood and not to act violently or as much as they please. Martin Luther King said I have a dream because he looked at his origins and the ancestry and saw that there is a great need that his descendants will not continue to be a people of slaves and dreamed of being a free people equal in his country, but you are a Jew who has already left From the house of slaves by the Creator of the world from Egypt and you were privileged to be included in the chosen people who reigned over all the nations of the world when the Temple existed and all this was taken from us because of the rebels of the kingdom of heaven like you so instead of dreaming of purpose you continue to dream of vanity. You are the one who rushes in your lineage to Rabbi Eliyahu Hagar. The saint describes to you that he would dare to tell a people like you a dream to get to the World Cup instead of bringing Messiah. You can be sure that the Messiah will not be the one to give the trophy to the world champion, he will be the one to give us back the crown worthy of leading the world and he is the creator of the world and not a cult of clowns.",1
"You did not understand. Assimilation = Holocaust. It may be a silent Holocaust, but it threatens to lose the Jewish people.",1

I dream of peace and you of football! A wasted dream!,1
"Ruby, stop being stately, from this bullshit, stop bowing to the media. Be who you are in real life, !! And by the way, the court allowed you to demonstrate, so do not talk about incitement.",1

You have no right and everyone who donates donates organs! You received a whole body and will return it whole and I am not talking about the halakhic prohibition that there is in it!,0

"I am very disappointed with your position. ""Incitement"" is not the main issue but the shocking phenomenon of assimilation, which destroys the house of Israel and constitutes a betrayal of the family, the people and its God. Your response lacks a value-based and moral approach to intermarriage and the need to do everything and prevent them. Addressing incitement and ignoring assimilation is inciting the issue in a negligible direction and turning a blind eye to the issue. """,1
"Reuven Tell me you, if the love of your life was Arabia, would you marry her? Haha I do not think ... your late father, family friends etc would hang you on a really high tree.Why because they are primitive ?? Absolutely not.Because then there was another era of more solid values ??and morals.Today everything becomes Tu An open match as if everything is allowed because of progress. I mean 21st century. I am quite traditional and even I will not allow myself to think at all assimilating and not to mention marriage.

"Honorable President, maybe we will start with Ahmad Tibi and Hanin Zoabi !!!",1
"Addressing the President of the State of Israel is obligatory with respect to the President, since we are not your personal friend, Mr. Amsalem. The dignity and freedom of every person is to do as he pleases. The couple in question represent Israeli society and its cooperative future with different populations. There are Israeli Arabs who are more Zionist than you and me and have contributed and are contributing a lot to his country. I wish everyone to sober up from the cynicism and understand that this is a democratic state and not a state of halakhah.",0

And we are not a Jew living among us and between us. Sure you'll succeed - I have no shadow of a doubt. A weekend full of unity in peace and security, Mr. President. """,1
Good person successfully,0

One should beware of assimilation. Do not encourage and approve in the name of democracy,1
"I am sure you will succeed, you are the right man without a doubt in the right place, good luck to the lover of Jerusalem and the people of Israel",0
The main thing is not to interfere with Mahmoud and Morale to establish a nest of lovers Ah Mr. Rivlin .. Resign!,0
Guy as one who does not know who his father is I can understand you but check well I'm sure he's a Muslim,2
Honorable President and it was so clear that the man Reuven should be the president..the man of Jerusalem..the man who for years maintained the values ??of his best education you in your personality will be the president of everyone..but the same party you were loyal to for years must pay and especially the one who stands and in your way will be blessed State of Israel,0

Her people are sad.,0
Shame to Calculate Democracy Against Our Religion Honorable People Not to Believe Hearing It Really Unpleasant I Wish Their Deaths Instead of a Wedding Shame in the days when murderers and cooks are Arab Arabs and terrorists enough We have enough spices not to encourage them to be expelled from the country,1
Barak We are Jews who understand what it means to be a Jew,2
"Not believing it turns out that the chair affects everyone. Where are your values ??first and foremost as a Jew, would you as a father agree that your house should marry an Arab? Will you convert to Islam? I have heard a lot of reactions to this matter, but the real harm is when someone you do appreciate turns his skin that way.

Very well deserved well done,0
Not in favor of the wedding but definitely agree with the dear president,0
Mr. President Every person is allowed to decide on his life but to convert to his religion in these tumultuous days to convert to Islam what her spouse wanted the natives not to be Jews you are talking about racism they want to destroy us because we are Jews Honorable President you I wish success health and happiness,0
damn it !!!! Let them already do something in our government,1
It is gratifying to hear that one of the most influential people in the country expresses his opinion on the subject and even more gratifying when it is the President,0
"Dad, Grandpa - lovely !!!",0
"The cruel fate of a little boy, now he is an angel",0
What do you and the Torah and the laws suddenly do not buy your desperate game a sin and by and large you should not be a hypocritical president of Israel,1
"Mr. President, there is no such delusional reality in all the countries of the world! How is that possible ?!",0
The people of Israel have a more united life than ever,0
The free choice of every person without coercion must be respected,0
Alas for us a president like you !!!!!!!!!!,1
"What is this nonsense ? There is no doubt that everything you have written is net politics. You are the president of a Jewish state and you wish good luck to a couple who are destroying Judaism? Your claim that this is racism is so untrue but you had to align with the left that controls the media. You're barely a month on the job and you've already humiliated us. You will reset yourself, you are the president of the State of Israel, after all, it is the state of the Jews. Halas quotes Jabotinsky. You will start quoting Sages or the Bible. So I wish the new couple that with God's help she would escape from him before he got pregnant because he married her. She must live in hell. But we are Jews and we will save her because that is our job. You have nothing good to say about the Jewish people. Just shut up and do not support assimilation.",1
Finally a normal president,0
"In Israel, if the president is not a Shalmanzi, he is sent to prison for rape or bribery or whatever comes to them in the dictatorship of the Getz, then what a wonder",0
I understand ... So in the name of the fucking democracy that buries us all and gives Zoabi a stage terrorist in the name of democracy and Tibi calls it good to be a martyr (also in the name of democracy) but Jewish values? No way ! Anyone who advocates Jewish values ??is a racist! Everywhere in the world they hate us History has not taught a lesson ... Our fathers strictly observed the commandments and were murdered in order not to change their religion ... And here? In the Jewish state? Everything is allowed in the name of the Enlightenment! Just a shame for those who are in favor! And do not answer me at all all the shameless ones of your kind you have an account upstairs ... your fathers are crying over you,1
"Sad, terribly sad !!!! Of blessed memory !!",0

Congratulations Your Honor The President loves you,0
I'm proud to have a president like you. Just coming to the funeral today and picking up the coffin is not something we are used to from presidents.,0
exactly,0
"Honorable President, your response can be interpreted as encouraging intermarriage .. Are there issues that should not be interfered with ?????",1
Could not have been a more successful choice !!!!!!,0
"Indeed, you will remain faithful to your path without the polytheism that exists in this dirty Knesset.",0
How good it is to have a president like you! May you and the whole house of Israel have a Sabbath of peace.,0
"Today I passed by the President's house,, and I could not enter .. When can I come to visit?",0
How do you proceed from here? What a pain!,0
Dear Robbie Rivlin. Be strong and strengthen your courage and fairness,0
President Rivlin You are great and every herd against assimilation are narrow-minded racists The right of every person to marry anyone who comes to him love A religion or sex has love because love does not depend on what his nose Rivlin Reuben you are president of the people not of the people who once worshiped and now swear and curse then You are a shame and by the way Rivlin is a fan of a non-racist cultural school,0
Democracy is a two-way street. There is a right to demonstrate against assimilation as long as you do not resort to violence.,1
"Mr. Rivlin, just do not bow to him. Talk to him about the ongoing incitement in his media, tell him that we will never give up on the Land of Israel and the settlement of our people in Judea and Samaria and that he must immediately dismantle the partnership with Hamas. Tell him in his clearest nature that only under the sovereignty of Israel will his people enjoy freedom and prosperity and that Jews will pray on the Temple Mount together with Muslims and will not give up this right.",1
"Dear Ruby Rivlin, I wanted to share with you about your happy day when you were elected by a majority of votes to be the tenth president of the State of Israel. I was the happiest in the world because you were the most worthy candidate of all the candidates. Wishing you success in your new role and always remember that at least one happy citizen is elected. Straight force and strong and embrace!",0
Well done to the President,0
"Dear Ruby, there is a lot of pain in the people who seek comfort, unity and equality - for your treatment, thank you.",0
Sad. The heart hurts,0
"Good luck Robbie dear man, may you have an interesting and challenging term. There is no country more deserving than you to be president.",0
"After what you wrote here, you are very (very!) Proud that you are the President of the State of Israel. If there is any justification for this role it is in these rare moments.",0
Probably,0
But it is natural for a Jerusalemite to have the roots of the president,0
Shame to read the comments here ... You will learn what democracy is,0
Finally . How important it is that it comes from a state figure.,0
Our President Ben Jerusalem is the eternal capital of Israel. Who will give and in the days of your presidency true peace will be achieved within us in our people,0
"My personal request to you, Mr. President Reuven Rivlin. I would ask you to instruct all Knesset members in Israel to stop the false use of the word ""drips"" when mortar shells and missiles are actually being fired at us. Even one shrapnel is not a drip. This terminology is particularly manipulative and has opinion theft. It is a pity that Knesset members have fallen into the trap that the media has buried for them, and they are deliberately and unknowingly adopting the lie. Anyone who uses the word ""drips"" indirectly participates in the continued firing of shells on Israel, and without responding, because it is, as stated, only ""drips"".",1
Thank you - Israel so needs leadership like yours!,0
What fun it's you,0
"No one in the world has the authority to do anything that is against the Torah and as Jews we have to protest and it is not a matter of racism it is a commandment of Gd and for that it is not possible to pass or change even in the name of democracy. Deuteronomy Chapter 7a ""That will bring you, O Lord your God, to -The land, which-you-came-her-name to inherit; And many nations shall be cut off from before thee, O Hittite, and Gershom, and the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusites; seven nations, many and great among thee. And the LORD thy God hath set them before thee, and thou hast smitten them: they shall utterly destroy them, thou shalt not make a covenant with them, nor make a covenant with them. Thou shalt not marry, neither shalt thou give thy daughter to thy son, neither shalt thou take his daughter to thy son. D For he shall take away thy son from after me, and others shall serve God; And the LORD hath wrought in you, and hast destroyed thee. Thou shalt do unto them as they have done: their altars shall be broken, and their graven images shall be broken; And their blessing, Tideon, and their idols, will burn with fire. For thou art a holy people unto the LORD thy God: in thee hath the LORD thy God chosen thee, to be a people unto the people, unto all people, that are upon the face of the earth. """" """,1
Some respect for what our dear president has is not allowed to express an opinion we live in a democratic country,0
Mr. Ruby Rivlin .. I did not expect to hear such things from you ... Do not become a shaman of all the rubbish of Shimon Peres ... As a former Betar chairman you should support the right and not the bastard Muslims .. Say what you say an Arab can not marry Jewish point!,1
"Although you are a clear right-winger, and there are disagreements between us, well done for the courage to stand up for democracy. And not to succumb to racists in the streets. There is no left or right in this issue. In V-R who interprets Rivlin's words as leftist. Standing up for the couple's right to marry is part of upholding our rights as citizens, to do as we please as long as we do not break the law and infringe on the freedom of others. You can be right-wing and democratic. Enough with the fuss",0
"So many shocking reactions that embarrass Israel and every Israeli wherever he is, too bad ...",0
Your snobbery in the face of the bills against the traitors I personally will not forget and hope you are not elected even though there is no one worthy,1
"Against Arabs, against assimilators, but for the presidency. Long live the President.",0
"Why do you not condemn the Arab doctor who put a picture of your prime minister as a vampire who eats Palestinian children? This is also violence, and Bibi is a Jewish Israeli citizen who is the pride of the State of Israel. The inciting calls against him are also an integral part of the Israeli experience. And I suggest that you start condemning the phenomenon from there on the Arab side, long before you turn to the Jewish side. For thousands of years we have been murdered and carried out in pogroms and until we get tired and we go against or express the opposite position we are ""punished"" and the ""manager"" calls us to order. Fucking the country. Shame.",1
"The woman with whom, modest and value-wise, we have long missed such a thing. Good luck to both of you in the presidency.",0
"You support assimilation, you honor the president disappoint me and I am sorry I chose you. It has nothing to do with democracy is a mistake ......",1

"Mr. Honorable President, Like many citizens I very much respect and honor you, and I am glad you were elected President, but I must strongly protest against your statement: ""Not everyone must rejoice in the joy of Mahmoud and Morale - but everyone must be honored."" ""During the Six Day War she did not win Israel to excess support from Britain. Its then foreign minister was a gentile named George Brown, one of the few people I heard whose anti-Semitism had some degree of understanding, if not justification. Why? Because the aforementioned George Brown married a Jewish woman I know the details of the story, because as a native of East London my late mother knew the woman's family. Mr. President, without referring to the couple in question, but as a general rule, intermarriage is cancer In the body of the Israeli nation. This is not my determination, this is acceptable in Israel for generations. You are wrong, Mr. President, when you mixed the issue of racism against Arabs - which I also strongly oppose - with the matter of intermarriage. I have no problem defending racism. Against Arabs. But in practice you have given a presidential seal to intermarriage, and thus, Mr. President, you are failing miserably. ""And"" ""marriage"" """" the same root, and I hope you will find a way to correct and clarify your position against intermarriage, to correct the defect in your presidency that your statement has caused. I wish you success throughout your tenure. """,1

President of the State of Israel,1
"Someone commented to me Natalie are private individuals getting married what .... and I could not see the sequel. In any case, they are not private individuals who marry in principle. His father said explicitly, and on his own initiative, that he was a ""Palestinian"" and if they were freedom and liberal advocates like Moran supporters on our side they would not force her to convert to Islam. Go to them. Within a week she was a mother slave. This is one of the new levels, and the easiest in the situation of today's girls, to slowly disintegrate Judaism, to crumble it. That's what kept us in the Diaspora for 2000 years. But she will privately do what she wants, for me even when she starts getting beaten. ""And come and cry not to help her. I did not intervene, I did not share fan parties and I did not go to the demonstration, for me the struggle is the good education I received that also went to my brothers who go to my nephews and I will pass on to my children. This stupidity will not happen to us.""",1

For such statuses it is worth maintaining the institution of the presidency. I was looking for days for someone sane in this country to say things.,0
"Honorable President (by the way, for honor you have to work and we have not seen anything yet) The incitement in your words is not Jews against Arabs but against a reality where girls get married to convert to Islam and go through masks of torment and then beg to be saved unfortunately I have not met one who has not passed this mask. Their lives to rescue them so I ask why? What's good about it? And there is no answer other than complete blindness in the name of freedom of choice",1

"Successfully ! :) ... but maybe still a small request - since you see yourself as a representative of both the left and the right, it can lead to harmful acts precisely to the side you represent ... and it also happens to many from the national public who contact representative positions ... Your predecessor is known Did not think to represent them all, and presented only the left side, and we know that you are a much more honest person than him ... but please, - that all your actions will be directed only for the good of the people of Israel and not for harm since a certain side tends to do this evil thing ... and again successfully !",0

Only in the State of Israel is there a """" sluggish """" rule ... and I must ask the obvious question: Who pays you ?? With whom and for whom do you work ?? Certainly not for the people of Israel because you act and act as one who wants to bring destruction to the people of Israel , Fear, disgrace, fucking and non-stop terrorism ... The people have chosen the right, the security..and you what? .... Indecision, charisma, creativity and confidence ... So again: for whom are you working ??? !!!.

In order for them to be prepared to bring Christ and receive him, God has granted us to live in the Holy Land and precisely here we do the opposite of what is expected of the eternal people, in the democratic name that destroys every good part, I hope that from this great darkness we will go to redemption immediately.

"Mr. President, I would like to hear more Jewishness in your messages. We have forgotten who we are, we have forgotten why we are here. We forgot why we were deported from here and at the time of the deportation we were promised that we would return. The president of the Jewish state does not have the privilege of standing in the middle of the sections of society, without siding with the Torah of Israel. Without the obligation we have as a state to raise with our awareness and identity as Jews !!! And that out of so much pluralism, progress and crop that has infiltrated our society from destructive self-interested factors we have moved away from our identity. Even if this specific case was lost, you must understand that your words as president are heard in all sorts of places including other girls who are sadly in this difficult situation. Right now and you are serving as an encourager for them. I'm sure this is not what you want. And not just because of the horrific statistics that predict a life of slavery, humiliation, disgrace and violence. These are also and mainly because out of ignorance they impose on themselves Crete and so does the dumb mother of this particular girl. Went and danced on the blood of her daughter and also from ignorance and understanding of the seriousness of this act !!!",1

Gd foresaw that he was having ""love"" problems with our enemies so he said to expel the peoples who were here 3000 years ago (to Palestinians) so that we do not encounter them ... why do you think alone they do evil in the eyes of Gd working for other gods ... that their work was probably one of the most stinking for those who have learned and know what it is ... they will miss us and our daughters and sons and Gd does not want the people That he chose him to mingle with other Gentiles ... lacking Jews? Missing conversions? No then start working! Gd commands us to marry whoever does not marry is a transgression we are commanded to love our wives as our body and respect them more than our body unlike Islam ... that a woman is an object that is used and thrown in the trash ... So a friend open eyes and start learning who does not know when it is Matan Torah so stop studying history Of Herzl and will study Torah a little ... """,1

Interesting - all the Arab terrorists here open under .... Interesting how and why ..... Continue to be a fifth recruit and be hostile .. The boycott against Arab businesses is only growing ... We have seen how businesses in Jaffa lose 70 percent of their revenues .... The boycott Against doing business with Arabs is increasing day by day .... Jews do business only with Jews ... We returned to the sources - Hebrew work .... You will also not get tractor jobs anymore ...,1
You're doing the propaganda in a great way for the Arabs. Right now we have a left-wing president. Look how proud the Arabs are of you.,1

European countries have already agreed to take in tens of thousands of Gazans. Union spokesman: Islam has already taken over Europe. What are a few thousand more Muslims? Israel is considering implementing similar activities in Judea and Samaria. A senior official said: ""We will end this once and for all."" Jordan announced: We will take back all the Arabs from Judea and Samaria. The left is threatening: If the Gazans' migration to Egypt does not stop, we will join them, and in addition we will have all the Africans joined us! I woke up ! Wow what a sweet dream I had .. wonderful Monday morning",1

In short a flame organization does what they have done in the past of the state an interfaith action only you like many in society have been so used to memorizing the motto of this filthy organization without noticing the horrible things they are causing. Before this organization goes out to protect girls who go with Gentiles because they are beaten according to your claim he will first take care of rescuing girls who marry Jews who are beaten / raped / murdered and there are quite a few. Is this exactly what was in Germany in those dark years that saw the Jews as a threat instead of us being the ones who eradicated the phenomenon are we the first Jews to recreate it? Apparently the history you learned about the country and the history I learned is not the same one.,0

Destruction of the people ... destruction of honor .... betrayal of the Torah ... come on. Listen to yourself. What silly slogans. Mr. President: You did the right thing. You have backed democracy. And this is very important in these days of right-wing and messianic strife trying to go threatening the unity of the people.,0

"President Rivlin, I held you very strongly, but as soon as you gave legitimacy to assimilation ... if the situation were reversed and the Muslim converted to Judaism? The Ishmaelites would slaughter him for it without thinking twice - the goal of Hamas and all organizations want to Islam us and our daughters.",1
"1 . Decent is not selfish and it does not matter where your sister was raised. There are hundreds of stories I will not go into because it is not interesting, but playing it enlightened at the expense of other cases does not make you right. Because it's factual that you yourself do not see how your sister will date an Arab guy. And here's exactly the point.",1

Garbage Can President If this is your reaction I am ashamed of you You support assimilation of the Jewish people! The truth is I was in your favor I probably made a big mistake in a few years the Jewish people will become extinct because of people like you,1

"A hollow voice answers the selfish name hears. Mr. President, your unfortunate announcement was better and unspoken. For generations the Jewish people have survived assimilation and survived, the State of Israel has risen not only to group the rejected of Israel in their country nationally and faithfully and to solidify them as a people. Recent. The state invests millions in Jewish education in order to stop the waves of assimilation in the Diaspora. What is happening in our country that hundreds of thousands of Jews are married to Israelis who hate Israel who want our extinction? And you speak in the name of democracy and love. Your words that seem to be stately are an encouragement to those girls who have not yet crossed the Jewish suicide line. To remind you that the Torah forbade the unification of Judaism with Gentiles, the Torah is still an educational and directed factor for the Jewish people. Mr. President, what will be your reaction, God forbid, if your daughter or granddaughter crosses the line and unites with an Arab, will you still wish them peace and joy in the name of democracy?",1

It does not seem strange to you how fast you act like with Shalit in an organized campaign, even it looks similar .... Open your eyes Haim Yativ 4 hours ago I was told in the news and that the government prevents publication on Friday . This whole story stinks from A to T, the one that did not publish and did not ask for the public's help as soon as it became known, but only before Saturday, all the contradictory publications of the police and the army that received a report on Hotline 4 at 22.30 on Thursday and that the army supposedly knew about it Only at 6 in the morning and the story of the head of the Mossad who a week ago opposed a bill on the release of murderers and said """" ""What will you do if they kidnap girls?"" ""Listen friends we will not wait like in the Warsaw ghetto to eliminate 95 percent of us to wake up and take proper care of traitors We have events and whoever made an army and understands with a weapon that will see this video I made about the murder in Brussels https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XlW9dHSq68 Bottom line, we have traitors in power just like we had Papuans in the ghettos and camps, the people It's too late to replace all the top people before they kill us all. Enough is enough. They brought terrorists from Tunisia here, gave them free murder, also provided them with weapons, trained them and released them after they murdered. What else do we need to absorb? They will now start soaping us with a committee. Investigation, etc. And once again the little police officer in the hotline will be to blame. Think: How did they set up a campaign? So neat so fast do not be fooled - they create psychological pressure once, to force the release of Barghouti and other heavy killers ... When you publish it, you help create this situation and play next to them. Ilana Shaltiel 8 hours • Tel Aviv has accumulated too much to ignore, facts that point in a very clear direction, and this article only reinforces my claim that this abduction is not exactly what we are told: Mossad chief Tamir Pardo """" What will you do if they are abducted in a week? Three 14-year-old girls from one of the settlements? """" Fredo asked Bennett and the other ministers, in what sounds today like a fulfilled prophecy. """" Say there is a law and no terrorists are released? """". During a meeting of the Political-Security Cabinet about ten days ago, which dealt with the Shamgar Committee's report on prisoner exchange deals and the Jewish House's bill to prevent pardon or mitigation of punishment for terrorists who murdered Israelis, Mossad chief Tamir Pardo outlined a scenario very similar to the abduction. . Fredo, along with other senior members of the defense establishment who attended the meeting, tried to persuade ministers not to advance the bill on the grounds that it would hurt the government's room for maneuver in future abductions, shackle its hands and prevent it from considering various solutions to deal with the crisis. http://www.haaretz.co.il/news/politics/1.2348885 Default: The police informed the army about the abduction 6 hours too late! Only 6 hours after the police learned of the abduction - the message was passed to the army. When the traces of the hostages disappeared, the police began investigating and even set up a police station, but the IDF only found out about the incident at 4 in the morning. The Knesset's demand to fire Minister Aharovovich of the Yisrael Beiteinu party for serious failures in internal security is increasing. Sha'ar and Frenkel left the yeshiva in the Kfar Etzion settlement at 9 pm and informed their parents that they were making their way home to Talmon and Nof Ayalon. Eyewitnesses described that shortly afterwards they saw the two standing at the Alon Shvut junction and trying to stop a ride in the direction of Beit Shemesh. At around 9:40 PM, Yifrach spoke with one of his friends and told him that he was waiting for a ride on his way to his home in Elad. At about 10 pm, the parents contacted the police following the disconnection with the three's mobiles, but the police were negligent and did nothing with this information ... The army only received the information at 4 am ... http://www.kr8.co.il/BRPortal / br/P102.jsp?arc=949055 Ohad Segev Conspiracy - and the truth will set you free You may have been """" kidnapped """" by order of the Mossad (which is now religiously controlled) to try to pressure the right to continue the policy of liberating terrorists And to try to repeal and circumvent the bill of Ayelet Shaked and Bennett from the Jewish home with which they will not be able to release terrorists. The law was passed only in 'Tromit', and the left is trying to torpedo it by creating media pressure on Knesset members who are supposed to vote in three readings until the law is approved. """,1

Mr. President I am sure you know more than one case of an unfortunate Jewish girl who married an Arab until the wedding was Idalia bought gifts etc. After the wedding the attitude changed and then organizations like Hand to Brothers in complicated operations find the same girls and help them rebuild their lives every now and then They are aware that the emissaries of the husband from whom she fled can reach her and harm her and her family do everything possible to stop the next case before it happens we in a democratic state like her right to marry him so our right to protest and demonstrate against the act she will regret and it will be concluded in a complex operation Another similar organization that wants a Jewish state of Israel and wants the daughters of Israel to marry the people of Israel not to another people unlike the other two religions we do not try to influence people to convert what Christians and Muslims do so we want to maintain the existing Mr. President I very much hope you return from the statement to give your blessing to the wedding,1

"The ""Give a Hand to the Deaf and Handicapped for the Handicapped"" has been active since 1997, dealing with public representation in committees in the Knesset, meetings with MKs and ministers, municipalities and government ministries in order to promote the rights of the deaf and disabled on many issues. In many areas such as: State recognition of the deaf as disabled, access to government buildings, increasing employment of the disabled in the public and private economy, increasing benefits for the disabled and deaf, etc .. And currently, branches have been established throughout the country and abroad, and the association volunteers: professors, lawyers and auditors From its inception until today, all members of the association work voluntarily and all expenses of the association are financed from their own pockets. For this reason, the association decided to work for the receipt of section 46 (approval from the tax authority that allows donors to be taxed). Taxes that it is not possible to receive section 46 as long as there is no minimum income for the association in the amount of NIS 30,000 per year (in money or products).

"In honor of the President-elect of the State of Israel, Reuven Rivlin, we were very pleased to hear the good news of your election to the high position of President of the State of Israel. We have prayed many times for your victory, and we have even recited Psalms for your success. We very much expected and wished that you would be the person to win the title of President of the State of Israel. For indeed in our eyes you represent a symbol of honesty and decency, a moral masterpiece, love of the people, love of the Torah and love of the land, you have great respect for the heritage of Israel, you are a man of Jerusalem and a descendant of privileged families, and you carry this heritage proudly. To bring about unity with Israel, to seek the good and common and beautiful in Israeli society, and to unite the people around the Jewish and Zionist values ??we all share. To respect the Torah and the heritage of Israel, which is the spiritual resilience of our people and state, to respect the land of Israel you love so much. And Sheila the Land of the Bible. And we wish you that you will have great success in the great role and be a moral example to the whole people, and all will rejoice in you, and be proud of you. And also towards the countries of the world, she will represent the State of Israel with dignity and splendor. He ascended from strength to strength, and sanctified heaven there, and will add respect to the Torah of Israel, unity and love among the people of Israel, and a spirit of faith in the righteousness of our yeshiva in the Land of Israel. Love and wish all the blessings in the world, Avraham and Tamar teach Arad N, B, a very interesting thing I put to him in this week's Torah portion 'Shelach,' elected president on Tuesday for Parshat Shelach, where 'Aliyat Shlishi' deals with the sin of the spies who slandered the land Of the Land of Israel, and in the punishment they received for dying in the plague as well as for the rest of the people it was decreed that he would remain in the wilderness for forty years and not reach the Promised Land alone, one son of Jephunneh who remained faithful to the Land of Israel. And you were the only one of the presidential candidates who was loyal to the Land of Israel in those difficult days of the disengagement and displacement of Gush Katif settlements. And the verse was fulfilled in you that thanks to the other spirit of loyalty to the land you had 'won to come to the land' already. You were in it ... that is, to the house of the president who was almost elected to it 7 years ago and now D. Elki Yisrael has purified to come through its gates. Stay true to the values ??sacred to us, and bring honor and glory to the house of the president and all the people of Israel.",0

It is very nice that you attended the funeral so deserving of the President of Israel. But congratulations on intermarriage encouraging assimilation is an unfortunate statement that has no place in the mouth of the President of the State of Israel. And the educated at that time will fall asleep. You do not always have to say something,1

On the one hand the people of Israel claim that they have ancestral rights, that the land of Israel belongs to the people of Israel according to the Torah of Moses, It has not yet fulfilled its destiny ... and according to the Torah of Moshe Rabbeinu, the condition for the existence of the people of Israel is the existence of the rule ... and love for your neighbor as yourself .... and as we know, a rule must be included from all the details that are called rules, and if one detail is missing. .. there is no existence at all .... In order to serve as a light to the Gentiles we must first discover the light within us ... for how can we serve as a tool that distributes light without the revelation of the light within us?",1

Apparently Rivlin was confused and thought he was the president of Fatah. I wonder at what stage of his priesthood he will open an investigation against him for something very mysterious that we do not yet know.,1
As the president of the state for the Jews and not for licking the Arabs !!! Arabs are especially enemies those with the blue card !!! And do not tell me racist etc ... I am a proud Israeli Zionist Jew who hates the enemy !!! And in this case the enemy is Arab !!!,1

"There is a good chance that such a marriage will end in failure, a good chance that if it was Rivlin's granddaughter he would have done everything to prevent it from happening, and yet, in a democracy their right to marry. Whether the public likes it or not. To work for assimilation is great, but to demonstrate with the aim of ruining the wedding of a mixed couple who have been dating for five years is ridiculous and its whole purpose is to provoke a cheap provocation by the Lahav organization. The incitement that is calling for a demonstration in order to preserve the Jewish people is a real disregard for intelligence, I find it hard to believe that all those demonstrators really think that the fact that they will make noise there and make a fuss will make the girl run away from the canopy and recalculate the route.",0

"Sorry . Hunter jumped at me ... I will continue - the presidents of Israel were wise people, leaders, knowledgeable, God-fearing and loving others. Because of all these they got to be called presidents and lead every tribe and tribe. You, dear Mr. Rivlin, have won, and thus you have won us all, a president with a floor rate,. Not one who pursues honor and dominion, not one who has such and other titles at the forefront of his mind, does not rise above his brother. But a man whose humility is a milestone in all his dealings, the connection to the simple man, to the other is in his very soul, a man whose love for his people and country is the very soul of his nose. May you see a blessing in everything you do and in everything that comes out of your mouth. You and your wife, see joy in your family, in your new home, and good and steady health. Successfully !",0
"Mr. President, congratulations on this important post. Racism is a damn disease that is spreading rapidly in our society and is manifested in extremism in football matches of most teams (for some reason in basketball I did not encounter it maybe because there are no Arab players) and as a fan who comes to many games I am ashamed to hear all racist remarks I ask you in every language of request that your treatment of the subject, will not end in this post, and I hope and believe that you will move this subject to the top of your priorities. Thanks .",1
The heart is broken to pieces. All the terror of terror deserves to be underground !!!!!!!,0
"Boring and predictable post ... you forgot to mention what Sakhnin fans are doing on the pitches. Somehow this is always what the Jews do (and no, I do not justify racism). But if this country belongs to everyone according to what you claim from being elected president, then you will require everyone - and not just the Jews - to behave properly. It seems that you have reviews only towards Jews! It's getting embarrassing already ... I also have a dream, that you all stop being cheap populists! Your dream and that of the late Martin Luther King will most likely come before my dream. Shabbat Shalom Honorable President.",1
"Cancel, this is not a smart move.",1
"Sound I see the very active .. The President I quote revolted against racism and wished peace and tranquility to the couple. Is protesting assimilation racism? Should we sit and cry over this wedding? He, as the president of the Jewish state, should have set up a protest and a cry not to wish the couple who eliminates the Jewish people peace and quiet if it is racism? So I'm proud",1

With all due respect and there is no respect for why they had to emphasize the invitation of the anniversary to provoke the creators it seems that Arab would marry a Jew and would show her invitation yes who knows them at all she would stay alive Assimilation is the serious thing that God does not like and the bride will be careful Moral the blow that he will receive from God really hollow God and many more,1
Be strong and courageous,0
The right man in the right place and at the right time. Successfully,0
I'm in the market from the comments here! In that the honorable president denies racism and incitement he does not encourage assimilation. It is allowed to disagree and still let them choose and respect their choice without wanting to swallow them just because they made a choice that you (and probably I too) would not have made.,0
Shaltiel you are the harmful and leper extremist quite tired already with the empty slogans of the contents of democracy one hundred and twenty-one hundred twenty Zebi we are a Jewish state first of all it is time to raise your head and push people like you out of the state,1
"Since your support for assimilation this week, I feel that you no longer represent me and you are not the President of the State of Israel, and it is a pity that I have always supported you, but now you do not deserve to be President of the State of Israel.",1

"Do not disagree with your statement ""Everyone owes their dignity"" ""... Walla is right !! But, what is it"" ""Whatever my position"" ""???? If you have already referred to the affair, we as citizens do not deserve to hear your position on the issue of marriage itself Mixture ??? Where's Robbie who knows how to express an opinion ??

The president is allowed to express his opinion and we are allowed to despise his opinion and inform him that once he has expressed support for assimilation - he is not our president.,1
The President of the State of Israel gives backing to assimilation ?! ??,1
Good luck and you will succeed,0
"It is very disappointing that the president of the state has so far not found it appropriate to raise the issue of the Jewish people's connection to Judea and Samaria and the great folly that the government intends to establish a state for our enemies on their territory. And this is not a mistake, the Arabs have so far proved to be our enemy and this cannot be changed despite the leftist belief that sees them as our partners for coexistence in peace.",1
"Mr. President, I wish you many years of action and connection between the various sectors of the State of Israel",0
Honorable President Do you support assimilation within the people ????? I would like to hear your opinion with your house or your granddaughter would convert to Islam to live with an Arab.,1
You won a woman of valor a long time ago!,0
Cute Ein Sarid is close to me,0
Ruby you act like a chameleon on a painted wall ... the last one I would think would post such an unfortunate sentence ... !!! You gave her legitimacy and more girls to cut off a race of generations of hundreds and thousands of years who died for the sanctification of God and you come in one moment of stupidity and issue such a stupid sentence ... you are a disappointment to the people of Israel !!!,1
"Hard, no words!",0
Good luck our president.,0
It's fun for him that you're his grandfather:) and happy for me in <3 that you're our president,0

"Honorable President, I have a proposal for improvement that all Jews marry the Muslims and that is how we will become a Muslim state. These will then be clear that it is forbidden to marry Muslims. By the way, the infiltrators must also leave Israel, otherwise in another 30 years, there will be 300,000 thousand infiltrators here. So what do we do then? Therefore enough with the leftist enlightenment that threatens to drown the Jewish people.",1
"Tel Hai, Ruby. In all this sadness you were a ray of light of hope. There is indeed a president in Israel",0
A little righteous artist who will soon send strength to the dear family Amen,0

Honorable President Ruby with tears of joy this is one of the joys I was happy and cried with you. Thank God despite the trapped members who gave you back home you won the high position. I even lit candles and asked her to succeed. And yesterday I was at the X - ray son's wedding I asked the rabbi personally when he accompanied his son to the bride a greeting that would bless you for success. And greeted rose and success Ruby dear,0
"You, Mr. President, along with your predecessor, you are the only ray of light reminiscent of sanity. None of the people's elected came. Not Bennett. Not Lieberman. Not Landau. Not Danon. And no and no and no. They do not have the courage to appear in the face of the failure that led to the child's death. A government of impotence. None of them has the right to vote again. All 120 must be replaced",1
"I did not expect such a response from the President of the State of Israel and to remind you, Mr. State of the Jews !!!! Do not forget we with the book that for years the thing that holds us together as one and cohesive is the prevention of assimilation !!! Do not give it an honorable hand President do not be a part of it !!! Be like a prize that happens to Moshe to the Jews he is silent !!! (And of course if you chat with a marker on a wall he comes and is shocked ...)

"Ruby Rivlin ..... From your speech as President of the Jewish State, young Israeli girls can understand that marrying an Arab is good and kosher. The State of Israel spends millions against the assimilation of Jews abroad, and here you are taking advantage of a Jewish presidential platform to encourage assimilation. Have you thought about it to the Japanese you spoke to please the Arabs? Are you the president of Palestine or the president of the Jewish state?",1
"May you have many years of health and happiness, peace, blessings and success and all, from Baruch Zucker",0

Do not confuse the mind about Judaism and encourage assimilation of the Honorable President!,1
"Honorable President Reuven Rivlin. I belong to the left camp, and I do not agree with your political views. But I'm very glad you're my president. There is no one more deserving of the job than you. Well done and good luck.",0
Well done . rise and succeed . This reaction of yours is one of the proofs of why we need a president in Israel.,0
Who chose him at all .. Let Azazel go to another politician who was elected in Kombina. At the expense of the public,1
The next step is to provide the charity Hamas with free missiles so that it will increase employment in Palestine right should not and also there is no point in demonstrating but from here to wishes there is a distance if you continue so you will be Shimon's best friend he brought assassins and you assimilation !!!!,1
well done !,0
All this would not have happened if the generalization had not advertised the wedding invitation dozens of Jewish bananas marrying an Arab or a Christian no one bothered them. This bride loves advertising problems so there are some bees it seems to me that even Muhammad will suffer from it she will know how to make a mess for Muslims too because for me it is not love this girl is a source of problems. That the Arabs will take this into account,1
"Remember what happened to the flatterers in the days of Agrippa, their greatness did not withstand the calamity.",1
Honorable President will be healthy you are right,0
Dear President! It is clear to me that my late mother Miriam Ben Porat greets you from above! She appreciated your honesty! I of course join in the wishes ... I remembered that you were among those who carried her with the last honor ... Comfort I loved the love song you dedicated to our new president and your one and only husband!,0
"Honorable President, I listened excitedly to your speech in the Knesset. Direct your strength on the sensitivity to hold a modest and powerful ceremony at this time",0

He should definitely be the next president !!!,0
Mr. Our next president thank you for being happy that I was elected and freed my heart from the stress because I know you as a decent person from my immigration to Israel in 1956 and I played against Beitar Jerusalem with Afula-Balfouria while brothers in Beuf and Aminoff brothers and the goalkeeper Duik and in 1960 I moved to Hapoel Hadera and also played against Beitar Ahuva On you and on me therefore my wife and I jumped for joy as the Speaker of the Knesset announced 63 votes to Ruby and thus rose and succeeded a little reminder,0
Finally . How important it is that it comes from a state figure.,0
Must respect them? Who owes us you? A moron piece with a president's diploma. Does that worry you? As Lapid worries if my dear grandmother manages to fulfill the dream of the little Cuban pot for the grandchildren who will come to eat with her. What we have to do is just take care of ourselves. A piece of nothing that was emptied of emptiness. Because you are drugging the public with false and sinful messages to Gd. Just so you know you must not write this post if you are already talking about commitment. Because you are committed to the people you claim you are part of. You see I was right at first that you are an idiot !!! Just start writing For our benefit. Because it's your job !!!! and keep your personal opinions to your wife. I do not need to see your toilet here and do not want to imagine how you shit. For me you are nothing double nine with full zeros after him.,1
You do not need the President of the State of Israel,0
You have returned to us the trust and pride .... with your choice .... and wish you success and that no mishap will come out under your hand ....,0
"Ruby, from time to time we would love to hear you also condemn Arab terrorists living in the country of which you are president, not just instigators from the right side of the map.",1
Congratulations!,0
Our dear man,0
At least one sane voice in every hate =),0
"Dear President, In Israeli football, violence has always been concentrated. It was a symbol of violence. The audience that no one found fit to find a way to restrain us. In contrast players who have never, ever stood up and condemned their fans. If once or twice they would appear on TV and say so. Your behavior is not to our liking. Your violence harms our name. And when you go wild, you give us punishments that limit us in games of radius, and fine us. So if you really love us, then no violence. I have never heard such a face, neither from the association, nor from Captain, nor from players. So what are the expectations when it comes to the evening. The helplessness of various legal systems.",1
Blessed be the President!,0
Agree with you completely,0
"Great pride, good luck, honorable president !!!",0
"Mr. Rivlin, on your visit to the village of Arava, did you ask them there, why did the father take the child with him, to a dangerous place which he is also forbidden to take him there? His sure.",0
I expected more from you ..,1
"70 Faces of the Torah. True, there are many racist passages in the Torah about us being the chosen people, on the other hand in Leviticus 19 it says ""as one of you you will live in your land"" ""and"" ""and love your neighbor as yourself"" "". Therefore the Jewish religion is subject to much interpretation ... A state of halakhah is but a democratic state of the Zionist nation in the spirit of the Declaration of Independence, where freedom of religion and freedom of choice are also emphasized. As a Zionist, I strive for exemplary society, after all, """" Tseder Tzedek will persecute "" Who to love and not racist. Flame Organization is a racist organization that deflects reform assimilation against Arabs, etc. It uses racist expressions that deflect violence and alienate the exemplary society I want to create. There is more than one way to be a Jew. After all, 70 faces of Torah ... In addition, opponents of religion, To go against all the religious is also racism. There are many pluralistic religious ... """,0
When there is a new king should ask then I ask you take care of the young couples to buy an apartment Repeal the law Bringing equity from home successfully Mr. President,0
Dear Sir ... how much we sat idly by and did nothing. These terrorist terrorists will be caught. They will be put in a prison hotel plus free tuition and meals. At our expense ... until when ??? Death penalty and burial with pigs and we will see them looking for virgins after death.,1
"Excellent. You are in an extraordinary position to give hope to all of us who have not yet become racists and zealots for their Judaism. Please do not let the psychics here challenge you, you are one of the only strongholds of moderation and sanity left to us among the elected officials. We must know that this people has another chance to be a people that deserves to exist.",0
Congratulations our Lord President. Great success in your new role. God bless you. We are all happy with your joy and the joy of the people of Israel. May he sit on the presidency until the coming of the Redeemer of justice soon in our day Amen. Lots of love .,0

Exciting exciting exciting,0
What a beauty such a thing we have not seen before I wish tomorrow at such a time that you will be president,0
Mr. Ruby Ravlin and that you know what it is like to grow into the reality of an Arab father and a Jewish mother? Too bad for leaders giving up roots so quickly maybe that's why our country looks the way it does. Today is a Sudanese evening tomorrow and everything in the name of liberalism.,1
Well done Ruby. It is worth mentioning in one fell swoop the group's leaders in racism. In the rest of Jerusalem,0
Congratulations and many congratulations to the tenth President of the State of Israel !!! rise and succeed !,0
And here's the right one turns his skin .... Too bad you're not talking about the value of parenthood and referring to the bride's father begging her not to marry her boyfriend,1
You're the next president,0

I have had such a card for over 55 years,0
"Honorable President, it is not enough to beautify the pearls of tradition but to take action. Acts that will advance the correction of the sick society in which we live. I am convinced that if you fully mobilize to eliminate the ill-fated evil of the contractor workers you will succeed in this, and be your success the success of us all. May you and we have Shabbat Shalom.",0
Bless you for many years of being together,0
Is that what interests you the day after the war? We are tired of beautifying presidents,1
What happened Mr. President you turned your skin,1
well done,0
You're a big disappointment Robbie !! What are you trying to lick them for now? You know yourself that it hurts the Jewish people !! Would you approve of such a marriage in your home? Yes or No ? If you say yes you are hypocritical and if you say no you are lying to the people in your response regarding the wedding tonight!,1
There is a president in Jerusalem !!!!,0
That all the people of Israel will be proud of you and your wonderful family.,0
Amen and amen .,0

And who said Peres' shoes were the right ones ?????. For the presidency,0
A sane voice is finally heard on the right as well ....,0
Ruby you remember we swore in the bible you will let it be written in the bible that assimilation is a pity you swear and you will not know what it is also forbidden sorry I say in your case silence is worth gold I am ashamed of you you are a president who is not proud of his Judaism and willing to sell the daughter of Israel to a lowly There is in the Bible the story of Shimon and Levi who killed an entire city for Dina that it and they deserve it easily and materially that even on the eve of this depression he deserves punishment for not converting the Jew.,1
"Exciting in ""the success in whatever he turns",0

Good week Mr. President and good luck !!!,0
"Well done to the President of us all. The right of every person in a democratic state to act as he sees fit as long as he does not harm the foundations of the state. To all those ""concerned"" about harming the Jewish people, I suggest joining me and coming out against the religious Orthodoxy that prevents those who want to be loyal citizens and fulfill their dream. This is a large population of immigrants from the former Soviet Union who are making their lives bitter in their Jewish identity. """,0
"A red line passes between freedom of expression and left-wing demonstrations against the IDF in time of war, a red line passes between freedom of expression and Arab Knesset members who insult and incite within the Knesset itself. With all due respect to the President before you rush to justify assimilation in polished words please give your mind to the rest of the things I have written.",1
All the quarrelsome offer homework. Read on Wikipedia about the Nuremberg Laws.,0
"I like the similarity of your wording to Rabin's quotes. There are a lot of politicians who are already fed up with their empty sentences, sentences that come to please and say the obvious. From all these you ascend, and every word that comes out of you comes from the root of your thought and expresses the truth within you. Highly appreciates and supports the messages you give to the country.",0
well said !,0
"Hamas feeds on poverty, suffering, pain .. It shows pictures of orphaned children, ruined streets, destruction and devastation and as a result it receives donations ... like a beggar on the street who relies on donations due to his misery ... he, Hamas, tries to portray himself as a protector of the people , St. Mary in the eyes of the world ... when in fact things are completely different .. The donations that come to Gaza are used by the Hamas leadership to buy assets, planes, pocket upholstery ... dollars do not go to the population..on the contrary..the money goes to tunnels and armaments to bring suffering and destruction Another that will bring more donations and bank accounts in Switzerland .. Once Gaza calms down, there will be glorious streets, waterfalls, malls, tourist attractions and so on, Hamas will collapse .. Any such failed operation strengthens Hamas' economic status and pours billions of dollars into its leadership ... it Hamas is building on our humanism and our inability to harm civilians over time. This is also the reason why it uses the residents as a ""defensive wall"". It is photographed well, convincing and puts a lot of money in. Every child is crushed to pieces is more money. Just like speculation in women to make money, Hamas is speculating in children's lives for the same purpose. This is the only reason that as long as the suffering exists, money will flow to Hamas and therefore the dream of peace and two states for two peoples will not come true ... It is a kind of """" protection """" beautifully organized ... it is forbidden to fall and play into its hands .... From all ... the heads of the apparatus of this despicable terror organization who exploit the blind trust of their soldiers and in the name of Allah fill their bank accounts laughing happily at every space and death .. Take their money and assets and stop giving them money and see how they disappear just for the reason The simple thing is that it will no longer be a """" profitable business """". """,1
Strong well done !!!!!,0
"I also respect a person as a ""person"". My only problem is that we are with such a small population and encouragement of assimilation is it indirectly or actually directly erasing our identity as the Jewish people, and by the way, how does your reaction relate to what I wrote?",1

"If it comes to you, take a few seconds and read the following lines: Morale, dear morale, you are in the midst of days for an ordinary girl these days are busy with last arrangements before a wedding, and you, you are on the path to the abyss, the path is here soon and the time is coming to an end , Two years ago you went out behind your father's back with the enemy son of the Jewish people, but okay ... Now that your partner Mahmoud will erase his name and his memory ""will take ownership"" of you the things that might have seemed standard until now - will be reversed. Not far from Mahmoud's house, a few years ago a woman shirt, a Jew like you, with severe mental and physical scars after years of hell this world, for years she was obliged to welcome her husband who returned from work every day with a bowl of warm soapy water for the feet and a hookah lit, when she was Forgetting or not enough she feels in her flesh the smoke of a damaged memory ... This is just one of many examples of the black future that awaits you, go to the far shore a spitting distance from Mahmoud's house and watch how the wives of Israeli Arabs coming to the sea dressed - yes, exactly Like anywhere else, with no relief while their husbands bounce in the water with a lightweight boxer shorts. Morale, if things had not stopped only for the comfort of your life and your personal safety - Dayan, many people make mistakes and pay with their bodies / finances / sanity, etc ... But the harm does not end with the duty to wake up before your husband every morning or in any meeting where strangers I will have to be silent and not make a fuss, the harm is to all your people, and yes, I say 'your people' because the fact that you converted to Islam a few days ago in the Muslim court in Jaffa in Tel Aviv does not matter in any way the fact that you were and will remain forever. Is an unpardonable sin and a sign of disgrace to you and all of us will be dependent, Gd will sit up and upright with great sorrow, sorrow that will return to you like a bourgeoisie throughout your marriage to the scum that has accompanied you for two years ...

At this time it hurts me and hurts me to death that the President of the State of Israel does not understand the pain of a generation of Jews who do not forget what held our people as the glue of the Torah of Moses Ruby. Is this what you are transmitting to us? Instead you will comfort the parents and it is time to offer a sack to everyone who demands instead of quoting expressions of Zabotinsky who would surely protest the context of his writings on this subject Is this the new spirit blowing in the President's house ?? Is protesting the assimilation of the people a violation of democracy? Are we protesting the enemies of peace and democracy? What did you not understand Ruby? You have given us some hope but also you trampled on it with a handshake If you have some respect turn your place to your good neighbor Yahweh give courage to his people let Yahweh bless his people with peace,1

"To live together coexistence is okay but to let a Jewish sister get married is already something else because if not today, tomorrow a year or two she will come back and she will always remain a Jew even though they think she will convert a Jew will always remain a Jew born alive and dead a Jew only her soul will burn in her womb. If a gentile admits that there is nothing like a Jew and his religion then a Jew with a high level of intelligence should understand and help wrong brothers and sisters I will have an anniversary that smiles lol",1
